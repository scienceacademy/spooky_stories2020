<h1>The Eternal Nightmare</h1>
 <p>
   The night was a normal night, there was no difference between this night and the last. So why do I feel uncomfortable going home? You recall going to the movies with your friends last night to watch an extremely 
   scary movie, and it was. The movie was so scary that it was rattling my thoughts and I was having a hard time making words. It was tough to even remember things correctly. When I thought about this I thought what 
   can I even believe is real or fake now. After this I hurried home, While on my way home I said “I'm questioning my own thoughts now. That had to be one scary movie.” Once I arrived at the house I immediately got 
   ready for bed, though something felt off, it didn’t feel right. What was it, was it the gloomy walls, was it the creeping ceiling, maybe it was the cold, chilling floor, but whatever it was I didn’t like it. I run 
   to bed and swiftly hop in. The next thing I knew I was waking up so why was it still nighttime. I attempted to fall asleep again yet I couldn’t. So I hopped out of bed and walked around the house for a few minutes 
   but I saw nothing so I went back to my room but when I came back the room was gone. It just disappeared, at this point I was spooked and I tried to run outside to my neighbors house but when I stepped outside 
   everything was gone. I looked around and saw that I was in a dark abyss-like plane with fog and dark particles all around me. I ran back to my house and it too was gone, I was stuck in this abyss alone with nothing 
   around me. I heard loud footsteps behind me and tried to call out to whoever was there but I got no answer. Plus the footsteps kept getting louder and louder. I panicked and ran, I dashed for it but the footsteps never
   faded. I ran until I was tired and fell over, then I looked back to find a huge, spindly, being, with thin, razor-sharp needle-swords for arms and the creepiest mask on. That thing sparked my adrenaline into action and
   I ran again but when I looked back it was the same distance away from me my last thought was “so this is my impending doom”, then it impaled, and killed me. Just as it impaled me I woke up. I thought “Phew that was 
   scary” and got up and out of bed to head for the kitchen on the way to the kitchen the house started to twist and swirl, I was wobbling my way to the kitchen until a large hand broke through the floors above me and 
   scooped me up and hurled me across town into a nearby river. As I splashed into the river I returned but as the reflection on the water. With what seemed to be my body getting up and out of the water I was doing the 
   same but on the flipside. Yet with every move that I made it didn’t feel like mine. I may have thought I wanted to walk home but it wasn’t me who ordered my body to do it. As I made my way back home I wanted to wash 
   my face but I couldn’t. This was the first time my body disobeyed what I wanted in my head slowly as the night went on my body got more and more disobedient until I barely had any control over what I wanted to do. 
   I shouted let me get some water. But it refused. Then I shouted let me take a shower still it refused. All coming together now it seemed my body didn’t want to see water. Using all my willpower I forced my body to 
   move back to the lake where I then jumped in and swapped back to the normal world. Then I woke up. Again it was all a nightmare but, I wasn’t absolutely sure so. I wandered around the house again then returned to my 
   room, my room was still there. I walked outside and my neighborhood was still here. I sighed and said “What a relief” as morning finally rose.
