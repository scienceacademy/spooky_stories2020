<h1>The Battle Against Sirenhead </h1>
<h2>By Hojun Son, created on Octover 29, 2020, exploratio science per. 5</h2>
<h3>It was a successful day for the military troops. They just returned from a long battle with the enemy army losing less numbers as anticipated. As the troops marched, the sun setted.</h3> 
<h4>“Gentlemen, tonight the fight was on our luck, but the sun is not. Let us camp in the dark forest up ahead.” the General commanded.</h4>
<h3>And so the army went deep inside the forest. Deep enough so that the enemy army can’t see where they were. Deep enough to the point where there was mysterious fog everywhere. The once bright and blue sky changed to greyish and menacing color. Soon enough, fear inside the men seemed to whisper “my time has come for me to awaken.”</h3> 
<h3>“General, I think that we have gone far enough, the enemy cannot see us now.” one of the soldiers commented.</h3>
<h3>The general ignored. After 2 hours of traveling, the army finally made it to the General’s satisfaction. The army totaled to 100. They were divided into 4 units. Unit 1 would set up camp. Unit 2 would collect wood for fire. Unit 3 would be on the lookout for the enemy. And unit 4 would support if anything went wrong.</h3>
<h4>“Alright unit 2, go collect the fire wood. Don’t go too far outside the forest otherwise you might be in the vision of the enemy.”</h4>
<h3>After a couple hours, unit 2 has not returned. Normally, finding wood in a forest would take unit 2 around an hour, but when 3 hours passed, the army started getting concerned. </h3>
<h3>The setting of the forest, the grey fog, and ominous sounds frightened everyone, even the general. Soon enough, fear inside everyone’s minds started to develop bigger and bigger. It was like a virus multiplying once it infects a host.</h3>
<h4>“Unit 4, go look for unit 2. Report back immediately if you see an enemy army. This might have been the work of them so be extra careful.”</h4>
<h3>And they were off. Now with only half of the army remaining in the camp, everyone desperately prayed that unit 4 would return with unit 2, otherwise they were basically screwed. Rumours started to spread that unit 2 were all abducted by aliens, and the fog hid the UFO.</h3>
<h3>After hours of setting up camp, the general commanded his troops to set leaves on top of the tents so that if they were found, then they would be camouflaged. As unit 1 was implementing the leaves, a distant shirek was heard, followed by a thunderous roar. It came near unit 3’s direction. Unit 1, along with the general abandoned all their work and scrammed inside the tents. Hearts started pounding, eyes became giant, legs started to tremble like jackhammers.</h3>
<h3>As unit 1 stood by, they heard a sound. It was the sound of breathlessness and slithering. Madness came over everyone, except the general. In his years of being in the military, he had heard what danger sounded like. It could be guns, explosions, and screams, but this sounded different. It was one of the missing unit’s men! The general ran out to find one of the soldiers. The soldier was missing both his legs, and was desperately calling for the general. The general ran besides the soldier and grabbed his hands.</h3>
<h4>“Soldier, what happened to you and the unit?” the general asked.</h4>
<h3>The soldier's eyes were almost cloudy. His rate of breath diminished rapidly. His body looked like it had been ripped apart by a monster. The scar was pierced deep into the body, with blood oozing out faster than water gushing out from a destroyed dam. However, at his last breath, the soldier responded.</h3>
<h5>“G… general…. th...is enemy is a monster… run away.. he is coming…”</h5>
<h3>As soon as the soldier panted out his last words, his hand dropped from the general’s arm. The general’s hands shaked in rage. Whoever had done this to his soldier, they had no honor, and this was not something a regular enemy would do. </h3>
<h4>"Unit one, move out!</h4>
<h3>Without any warning, the general commanded his last unit to move towards where unit 3 died. This was not a smart move for the general, but nobody can just stand still when they see their own die like that.</h3>
<h3>  As the unit of 20 marched towards their doom, the fog around them got thicker and thicker, soon blinding many. This did not frighten anyone, as they all knew that the inevitable ending was death. A soldier suddenly flew away from the unit. All at once, the unit stopped and readied their guns. </h3>
<h3> The world, itself, hit a red light. A gruesome chomp echoed throughout the forest, like a wild hungry lion downing its prey’s head whole. A distant boom plowed through the ground. Then followed another, louder boom. Then another, and another. The more the unit waited, the more ear-splitting the sound became. The calamity finally showed itself. </h3>
<h3>The tree-like figure stood like a titan. This terrifying-being stood taller than any trees in the forest, almost blending into one of the trees. Its hands were shaped like a knife, sharper than razor-edged knives. Its arms extended longer than any of its features. Its torso was the shape of a human’s torso. And the most frightening of them all, its head was a siren, with a horse-like mouth inside. </h3>
<h4>“Fire the guns! Throw all the grenades! Kill that thing!” the general ordered.</h4>
<h3>A barrage of shots of pistols, shotguns, and automatic guns were fired. A dozen grenades were tossed. The sheer power of the weapons cleared up the fog, making the sirenhead more visible. To the unit’s shock, the sirenhead remained standing, showing no sign of damage done on it. </h3>
<h3>The monster screamed a distorted-like siren similar to ones from a broken nuclear siren. It seemed to smile as its thin legs started to sprint towards the unit. The weapons of the unit were futile. There was nothing they could do, but to be killed and eaten. The terror for certain death slowly broke the unit’s minds. One by one, each soldier was skewered by the siren head and eaten. All except the general.</h3>
<h4>“Hah… I knew something like this would happen. I knew an enemy troop couldn’t stoop as deep as the murders you have commited. In fact I don’t even know who you are. However till the end I won’t sto….”</h4>
<h3>A sharp stick-like needle pierced through the general as he was about to finish his sentence. It appeared like a hot knife going through butter.</h3>
