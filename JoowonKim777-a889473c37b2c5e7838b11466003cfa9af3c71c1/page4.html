        <p class = "stage">On the stage, the man saw it. Thanjario, staring, his mouth wide open, his baton laying on the ground. The man looked around him trying to find out what was wrong, trying to find the source of the feeling of dread and apprehension. The music had stopped, replaced by a less pleasant blowing of the wind. The man looked around, looked in the back, looked behind instrument cases, looked everywhere. In the end, the man gave up, for, without the music, the flame could not last, and the man needed it, he needed the flame more than anything. But it didn’t need him. The man collapsed, then begged, begged like a dog on a cold winter night, begged like a puppy when meat is cooking and begged like a beggar who had lost everything.

        <p class = "man2">“Play it, play the song, my maestro, for the flames can’t wait long,” he said, grinning a sheepish grin.</p>
        <p>Thanjario looked at him with disgust. But he did not know of the flame, and a request to play neat and orderly sounds that would drown out the man’s foolish demeanor was good enough. So, picking up his baton, wiping away the dust, the misanthrope breathed and the sounds played again. 
</p>
        <p class = "man2">The man then began laughing, for the flame hurt him so much. The heart was gone, ground into nothing but fine dust. The legs were dancing with no structure and order. It was chaos,  and a certain beauty emitted from it which Thanjario noticed. And now, the flame grew greater, bigger, larger, and brighter than ever before, the bombastic, choir, the serenity of the woodwinds, the boldness of the strings, and the power of the drums, the fire loved it, every second of it. It danced and danced and danced and danced and danced under the red light, the red light, brighter, brighter, ever brighter. The man could not see, for finally, at last, the strings reached his mind, his thoughts, his memory, all of his rationalism was burnt into nothing, nothing but fine, fine ash. What good did the man do with it to save and bolster the flame? It was inevitable. It was only a matter of time before the flame won. For it always wins, but each time it does, something different happens. But the man could not think. Not anymore, and never will. For that is the way of the flame.
