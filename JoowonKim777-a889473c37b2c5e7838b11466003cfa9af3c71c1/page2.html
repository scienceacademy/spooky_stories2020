        <p class = "than"> Thanjario was a good man, or at least “good” when it came to producing sweet sounds. He loved the eloquence of notes, he loved the pleasant, soft tune that travels through a person’s ear whenever an instrument plays. He loved the simplicity but also loved pieces built from this simplicity which in turn created complexity.  Desiring to hear these soft tunes mesh and work together in perfect harmony, he dedicated his life to creating a place where the sweetest of sounds can emerge from metal pipes, wood carvings, and netted drums, all of it built to satisfy his growing desire for sweetness, equilibrium, and harmony, all of which make him an excellent musician, but a poor philanthropist. To him, men were messy, uncoordinated, and chaotic, always failing to decide one thing from another. As a result of this disrespect, he treated his players with an overall aloofness, while also treating admirers with deep sarcasm. However, the man did not know this, He did not know Thanjario, nor had even heard his name before the arrival. But it was the prospect of the symphony, prospect of musical beauty and elegance which intrigued him and invigorated him. No that is incorrect. The man was nothing but an impoverished maladroit. The flame wanted it, the strings wanted it, the red light lusted for it. For that is the way of the flame.

        <p class = "man1"><i>"My love! My love! We have a chance! I have a chance, for our children, for you, and for me! Thanjario! Thanjario is coming!
        The most talented, most prodigious maestro the world ahs ever seen! He will clear away the impunity and the ignorance of our civilization, he will 
        sooth the everlasting hatred and anger we men all store with guilt and pride! He will wipe away the disdainful and rephrensible mud that tarnisheds our childhood innocence! Oh I could laugh, i could go on and on what mthis means for us! 
        It means our city is being recognized! It means our little, tiny, miniscule, and insignificant city is finally known to the outside wordl! Think of all the 
        people that might move in, think of all the jobs, and most of all, most importantly my sweet flower, the glory. The fame we might receive!</i></p>
        
        <p class = "wife1"><i>"First off, Who is this Thanjario?” asked the wife, with an irritated expression.</i>
</p>
        <p class = "wife1"><i>"And second, don't be so foolish my dear husband. Just because people move in, just because this city gets larger, does not gurantte
        immediate prosperity. In fact,t eh way I see it, it's going to become so populated that we might have to leave! Then where would we be? Where would our little girls be?
        Where wold you be? Where? On the streets? Is that what you want? And what chance? A chance for you to embarrass yourself? Your not thinking about going onstage are you? 
        Ohh, it doesn't matter. It's all useless anyway. And what kind of a name is Thanjario? Isn't that an instrument name?</i></p>

        <p class = "man1"><i>“Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? I was thinking maybe I can take you and my children to listen to him. Heard he was a masterful conductor. Just imagine that sweet sweet symphony, playing their notes galore as if it was the only thing they ever want and need!” replied the man ebulliently.</i>
</p>

        <p class = "wife1"><i>“We don’t have enough coin. It is only for minds that can easily comprehend and understand the simple notes that play from within, it is for the people that have patience, patience to wait, and wait for a twist, a turn if you may call it that. No, we simply will not be able to afford it, much less enjoy it. How about watching the children? They’ll be heading off to their friend’s home soon. We don’t want our children to become little demons after all, do we? No of course you don’t.  Besides, if the friend doesn’t enjoy their company, you must comfort them, and accompany them for when the world abandons them, it is the father and/or mother that must take the place of the world.” </i>
</p>

        <p class = "man1"><i>“Well, at least the explanation is understandable and relatable. Alright. I surrender, my love. I will accompany my dear children on their futile sally against socialization.” </i>
</p>

        <p class = "wife1"><i>“There should be no surrendering, for there is nothing to surrender, This is your duty and as a father, you must fulfill it.”</i>
</p>

        <p class = "man1"><i>"No need to be so cold and rigid! You waved my enthusiasm away like a fly!"</i></p>

        <p class = "wife1"><i>"You know how I am. Safe travels my love. Don't come home too late. "</i></p>

        <p class = "tra">Tragically, that would be the last banter the two would ever exchange. For the flame is pervasive, and it will burn and it will keep doing so until the heart is merely a shriveled, deformed husk of its former self.  And the blood, the blood as it reeks of iron and shame, will seek to corrupt and tarnish those who drink it. For that is the way of the flame.
