        <h2 class = "head">A story concerning the inherent selfishness of humanity.</h2>
        <p>

        <p class = "p1">When our pride and arrogance are deemed unworthy and our egos are challenged by other men, a different reaction will take hold for different people. Many will brush it off, saying that they will forgive whoever has done the malicious act, as they are servants and children of God and the servants and children of God always pick mercy over an act of rigorous revenge. Many however will avenge their “fallen pride” claiming that they had their reputations tarnished, their pride tainted, and their egos spat on by an individual who was merely acting on their innate human nature. When the pride and egos of man are challenged, that is when the bright flame is lighted for the first time. It starts small, insignificant, almost pitiful in a way in the eyes of others. For a while, this small spark, this tiny heat, will comfort humanity, telling them not to worry, that everything will be alright, that the light is eternal and the fire will protect them, always comforting, like a mother nursing her crying infant. And after hearing this, the man’s pride is bolstered. He begins to make a life for himself, crafting a house from the unfortunate failures of others, shaping the floor with the hope of his loved ones, and finally, finally, creating a fireplace for his little heat. But that isn’t the end of the story oh no, for the man was deceived. The flame is not a benevolent force that wishes to help humanity by instilling hope, but rather a pervasive, parasitic and capricious snake, controlled by the strings, the strings being held by the Red Light. When the flame grows, it will turn on the man, and eat him whole, for that is the way of the flame is it not?

        <p class = "p2">He was a man. A man who had everything yet needed everything. A man who is always awake in bed, brooding, and formulating his next plan of action. He was loving. He was admirable. However, he was impatient, restless, and passionate. He was a man who never knew the word apathy. He was the light for those around him, encouraging others to put their humility aside and work for what they wish for. And everyone does, everyone does, and they thank the man. They lived in a small house, he and his family. It lacked a garden, birdbath, flower beds, and romance swings, but it did have days where the rain would slowly slide down the window panes. And when the raindrops raced voraciously, the children did as well, and the mirth could be heard for a thousand miles. The house didn't have an extravagant and resplendent roof but it did have a loyal and faithful wife, who not only scolded her children to a right degree but placate her husband by blowing a cold wind to appease and ease his rambunctious flame. For she was the counter to the grievous flame, the opposite of her husband. She was cold, apathetic, soothing, and calm. The darkness in her heart was infectious and will be dangerous in the face of anyone but the man. They needed each other, the wife needed her husband's flame, and the man needed her darkness. The house humbled it's inhabitants and allowed humanity to be truly grateful for what it receives. For in this house, fifty dollars means a month of food, warmth, and comfort, and a plate of food made by their dear mother meant that they would go to sleep amidst the pleasant and painless dreams. The floor was coarse and stained no doubt, but they could always pull a linen sheet above it and the children can go to sleep without worry, for the sheet's influence is immortal. But for the man, no for his flame, it all meant nothing. What can flame do in the face of linen sheets, laughter, and mirth? Oh no, for that is not the way of the flame, instead, a flame desires fuel, for it needs it to survive, to burn ever brighter. It ravaged the laughter of the children, it crackled when facing the cold dark of the wife, and it popped when fed the little raindrops hurling from the sky for the raindrops were the tiny moments of solace and accomplishment, which the flame thrived upon. It grew larger, stronger, and brighter, the ambition, the passion, the perseverance, all dared to take hold of the heart and choke it, squeezing out the blood then drinking it, only so that it could grow brighter. And there was nothing, nothing the man could do about it, for it was the way of the flame. The natural process of bloodlust and destruction and he merely was the next victim in the reprehensible cycle. The flame, its lust for fuel infinite, sought out Thanjario, for the man loved music, and always wanted to be a part of a concert. Clever isn’t it? It knows exactly what it’s bearer wants. Only then can it destroy the man and achieve infamy. For that is the way of the flame.
