        <p>The man went home that night, laughing, happy, happier than he ever was in his lifetime. The sense of fulfillment, accomplishment, acted like a drug. He was like a child again, dancing and prancing beneath the red light. He knocked on the door laughing, niggling, for the job was done. The flame had won. He had won. And no one, not even his wife, could reverse it. The wife grieved, for the man’s insanity. She grieved for his petty, futile desire, for fulfillment. For he had only made himself happy. Every night, before bed, the wife tried, tried to coax out the heart, tried to coax out the man she had fallen in love with. She kissed him, caressed him, complimented him, bribed him, rebuked him, insulted him, and even beat him. But no, for the flame had won. The strings had won and had long since moved on. Her love for the man paled in comparison to the flame, the everlasting flame. It meant nothing for the flame and it meant nothing for the man. Years went by, the wife hoping, and praying that the cold will touch her husband, that her darkness will consume him so that the light may ensue into yet another battle with it once more. Like the old times. When the stars were still white and when the cold was powerful. But all efforts were futile, for the man had already made his choice. His fate upon the book of heaven was sealed and nothing can be done to change it. However, the flame does not harm all. Man learns from each other’s misfortunes do they not? Because of the man’s delusional outrage, his children went under the care of the people of the manor, who managed to twist the grievous flame to their will, and used it nurture the poor souls, and the flame took care of them, instilling a passion stronger than that of the man’s yet more controlled and efficient. Even as they married the sons, gaining a share of the manor they admired so deeply, they never forgot the man, how he took them to such a place, a place where the flame was tamed and controlled and a place where they can discover the love which the man felt so passionately many years ago. But the man never changed. How do you convert ash back to flesh? And so it was, the wife crying and begging every night, while the man just laughed and smiled, for in his eyes, the red light had won, the flame had won, and the strings were dominant. All he could hear now was the sifting of the ash, and the cracking of the flame, burning elsewhere, helping and assisting others far off in the horizon. For that is the way of the red flame. And it will be so, even when all the white stars perish.
