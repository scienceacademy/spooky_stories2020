        “This trip has been going on for hours, I could’ve sworn we passed that tree like 10 times.” Olivia uttered in an exasperated tone. Five hours before, Olivia and some of her friends decided to hike on a new trail that opened last week in their city. When they arrived at the entrance early that morning, they were greeted by a tall security guard that made sure they didn’t have anything suspicious on them. 
“Alright, you’re good to go. Just make sure you don’t pass the gates past the rows of trees on the other side of the mountain, that area is restricted.” the security guard said in a professional tone. The trail was long and sandy and was filled with steep edges, bulky trees, and huge rocks. Thankfully the group was prepared as they were very experienced and brought a survival pack filled with snacks and a basic first-aid kit in case someone got hurt. After a few hours it was noon time and they had reached the end of the trail and were met with the row of trees and a big metal gate with barbed wire that the security guard mentioned. Right before they were about to turn back, one of the hikers mentioned that there were no other people in the area and that they could go past the gates. Olivia explained that it wasn’t a good idea, but everyone else wanted to continue on the trail, and Olivia was peer-pressured. As they walked through the gates, fog started forming until they could barely see each other. After a while, the fog started to fade away until they could see each other clearly. They thought that they had survived the worst of the evening until they realized something was wrong. Brandon, one of the hikers in the group, was gone and nowhere to be seen. A shiver ran down all of their spines as they called out to find his whereabouts. No answer. The group decided to go further and hopefully find out where Brandon went. After quite a bit of searching, they assumed that he chickened out when the fog came.
“Heh, what a loser. Imagine leaving your friends just because of some fog...”
The group chuckled but deep down they all knew something was off. Brandon was usually the smart one who was self-conscious about his ego and would never chicken-out last moment. They were all in denial. Later down the pathway, Olivia found an odd tree that almost seemed to be...moving? It was as if a long, skinny man was watching them from afar. As time went on, the pattern continued where there would be fog followed by the disappearance of one of them until it was down to Olivia and Zack.
	“I’m scared, Zack.”
By this point both of them were trembling in fear and staying close to each other until they felt long, scraggly fingers running down their backs wrapping around them both until there was nothing but darkness, with none of the hikers ever to be seen again.
