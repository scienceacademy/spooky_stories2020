<h1>The Goner</h1>
<p> 
Narrator:
</p>
<div>   
“Child’s name?” said the chief officer of the Tampa police department. It was August 15, 1984, and the Tampa PD chief officer, Rogers, and his team already had a case. Two parents had reported their child missing.
</div>
<div>
    “Uhh Amanda, Amanda Stevenson”, replied Will Stevenson. He had a scared and worried look on his face. The officers could have sworn it looked like the man who had committed a crime but regretted it. The cops believed him nevertheless. What else could they do? It was the father of a daughter who had gone missing, anything could have happened to her. After all, a father and daughter bond is an unbreakable one.
</div>
<div>
    “K. Hey Amy, come over here and help this mother out”, said Chief Rogers.
</div>
<div>
    “Ok, be right there sir”, replied officer Amy Bentley. She went over to help out Darlene Stevenson. She, too, had a scared and worried look on her face, and the cops also believed her. But there was one difference between Will and Darlene. Darlene had always hated Amanda. She always hated the way Amanda walked, talked, and even lived. The cops had even seen it. Will, well, Will and Amanda always got along. Many kids at Amanda’s school had always been sorry for her about her mom but jealous because of the dad she had. Many of the kids had always described Will as the “dream dad”. Will had the best job, he could fix anything, played with Amanda, but most of all made time for Amanda. Darlene didn’t make time for Amanda, Darlene always called her out. Darlene always hated the way she did everything. But now, Darlene was crying. She seemed sorry. She acted as if she wanted her daughter back. Amongst everything, she ‘promised’ to change. She knew it would take some time, but she wanted to change. “Hello, my name is Amy Bentley. I’m sorry about everything that is going on. If there is anything I can do for you please, please give me a call. And this includes absolutely anything that happens. It doesn’t matter if it is what someone said to you or something you found out about the case.” 
</div>
<div>
    “Okay, thank you very much”, Darlene replied as she was completely sobbing. She seemed broken on the inside. Amanda was her only child, Darlene didn’t show it very much but officer Bentley could tell that Darlene was somewhat broken. “We looked and she was gone. We didn’t know what happened. We went to go wake her up for school and she was just gone. She was just a little girl. Only 10. I don’t know what to do.” Darlene knew in her heart that the cops would never find Amanda.
</div>
<div>
    “It will be okay. We will find her”, officer Bentley replied. Officer Bentley was not sure about finding Amanda, but it was her job to make Darlene feel better. Moreover, it was her duty to make sure that Darlene and Will stayed out of threat. Bentley felt something fishy about Amanda’s disappearance, but she couldn’t say anything. It wasn’t her duty to question Darlene, it was her duty to help her.
</div>
<p>
 Amy Bentley:   
</p>
<div>
    The chief called me from his office which felt as if it was a mile away. All I heard was “Amy we got a case, lets go!” Of course, I was scared, who wouldn’t be? I never got told what the case was about even though I asked. I guess it was because I was a woman. I happened to the other ladies as well. The difference? They complained, I complied. It sucked, a lot, but what could I do? When we got there I saw a middle-aged lady, I would say maybe late 20’s to early thirties. Her name was Darlene, she was the one who got into a full-blown argument with her daughter two days before. Then a man came out, I assumed he was the lady’s husband. He looked mid 30’s. He was tall and seemed to have a scared and worried look on his face. I knew right away who he was. He was Will Stevenson. I couldn’t ask what the case was right then and there because chief Rogers was there. When chief Rogers told me to come and help the lady calm down and just be there for her, I went. I couldn’t ask her what was going on. I heard something about a girl going missing though. I assumed it was their daughter. I couldn’t tell for sure so I made sure to not mention anything specific about the case when I talked to her. I told her to call me if anyone said anything to her, or if she found something out. I gave her my card and my chief’s card. Usually, in this small neighborhood, no one mentions anything sad or worrying, but this, this was different. The neighbors even thought that she did it. Why? Because Darlene, the missing girl’s mom, and Amanda, her daughter, always fought. They even had the nerve to argue and physically fight in front of the Tampa Police Department. I saw how it all unfold and I saw how it ended, I was the one who ended it, but it starting was another story. Darlene had told Amanda to stop slouching and Amanda did so. Then, Darlene, just out of the random, started criticizing Amanda about how she does everything, from how she wakes up to how she sleeps. Amanda told her mom that she should take a deep breath. I didn’t think anything of it at the beginning, but when Darlene hit Amanda saying how she should keep her mouth shut and that she doesn’t care if they are in the forest or if they are in front of the police department. After that, I stopped looking and called in for help. Two men came and stopped me from helping. I didn’t ask why. I just complied. I just went over to the girl and asked her if I could walk her to school.
</div>
<div>
    “Uhh, yeah thanks. Could you, like, I don’t know, like, pick me up as well? My mom is out of her mind.”
</div>
<div>
    “I’m out of my mind! You are the one who decides to be a complete idiot! I can’t believe you trust the cops! They don’t do anything!” That statement never aged well, but here we are! Darlene is trusting us to find her only child who she promised to change for. It sounded strange, but I couldn’t judge.
</div>
<div>
    “Yeah, mom! They are the only ones who can ever protect me from you!” Then she turned her head to me. “So is it a yes or no?”
</div>
<div>
    “Uh yes, what time do your classes end,” I asked her. I wanted her to feel safe. I didn’t want her trust to fade from the Tampa PD like her mom’s did.
</div>
<div>
    “Uhh, today’s a Tuesday so about 1:00, thanks a lot”, she looked at me with a lot of hope. She was 10 but she acted like she was 15. Her attitude, her height, everything seemed as if she was 15. 
</div>
<div>
    “Yeah, no prob. And anytime”, I replied.
</div>
<div>
    It was insane to think that I had seen this girl 2 days before everything happened. I never saw her after that, I thought she might have taken the bus or something. I didn’t know and wasn’t concerned. I might sound mean but hear me out. I never thought that anything bad could happen to her. 4 things could have happened to her: She took the bus, she got sick, her dad dropped her of using the route he uses with her, or her parents told her she didn’t have to go school or made her stay home. None of these involved a missing child, yet she went missing. I never wanted to get up on that witness stand so I kept my mouth shut about the fight. Her mom never mentioned anything that happened 2 days ago and I didn’t either. I wanted to keep it out of the way unless she wanted to talk about it. I went back to the department and started working on my file. This really cute guy walked in. I didn’t know who he was, but he didn’t have any uniform, badge, or stripes on him so I considered him a civilian. I thought if he wasn’t a civilian he might have been a prosecutor.
</div>
<p>
    Mark Hughes:
</p>
<div>
    The first time I walked into the building, it was chaos. There was one really pretty and cute girl but she seemed shut out. I thought about asking her out. She looked at me and then saw the others were looking at me and went back to her work. I am a prosecutor and I use the info the cops have to build a really good case against whoever I’d have to. I went into the chief’s office, which wasn’t that hard to find. I talked to the chief about who I am and that I would be willing to work the case with him. He called the really pretty girl over and her name was something near Amy Bentley. I was stoked that I got to work with her. I talked to her about the case, she said that she didn’t know much. I figured something like that would happen, I talked to the chief about wanting to work with Amy nevertheless. He said that she was useless but he was willing to give her the info so we could use it.
</div>
<div>
    “Amy! You’re with Mr. Hughes”, chief  Rogers said.
</div>
<div>
    “Call me Mark,” I replied. I didn’t want her to know that I took a liking to her.
</div>
<div>
    “Hi, I’m Amy. I don’t know much about the case ―”
</div>
<div>
    “Bentley here’s a copy of the case file, get to work!” the chief said sternly.
</div>
<div>
    “What!?” She said it with such a confused but happy tone. “I have never gotten to work a case!” I looked at the chief then right back at her and gave her a look that she read right away. 
</div>
<div>
    “Thanks. Um, I really appreciate it”, she said it with such happiness.
</div>
<div>
    “My pleasure. Uhh, hey you wanna go to the coffee shop and talk about it there, here it’s kind of a really strict environment to be working a case.” I wanted to ask her out but my brain took over my heart. I thought it was a really bad excuse to go to the coffee shop.
</div>
<div>
    “I say we leave it. It’s a cold case”, Amy just blurted out. She said it quietly, but I was shocked. Amy then continued to tell me how she had looked into the case but found nothing and was willing to split the credit so we could get off the hook. “No body, no leads, and if there are leads, well, it just leads to nowhere.”
</div>
<div>
    “Ok, then how long do your usual investigations take.”
</div>
<div>
    “I’d say about 1 - 2 weeks.”
</div>
<div>
    “Ok, then we will talk to your chief in 10 days. You still down for coffee so it looks like we worked?”
</div>
<div>
    “Uh yeah hold on, okay yeah I’m ready.”
</div>
<div>
    “On me.”
</div>
<div>
    “Always.” She put a smile on her face. There was something different about her. I was happy that she said yes, but I wanted her. It was a different type of want. I wanted to help her out when she needed someone, I wanted her to ‘live it up’ with me. 
</div>
<div>
    One week passed and then it was the tenth day. I never got her number but I was certain I was going to get it today. I entered the building and everyone was doing their work. I entered the building and looked for Amy. 
</div>
<div>
    “Hey! Where were you?” I felt happy to hear her.
</div>
<div>
    “Hey, uhh I was uh looking for you. I was just, you know, thinking that maybe we go in together in on a pair so it doesn’t look bad.”
</div>
<div>
    “Uh yeah, actually I was thinking the same thing.”
</div>
<div>
    “Hey both of you come in!” chief Rogers called. “So what’s the call?”
</div>
<div>
    “It’s cold. It leads nowhere.” Amy seemed so certain.
</div>
<div>
    “Did you go over it? Hughes, did you go over it?”
</div>
<div>
    “Uhh, yes sir. It’s a cold case.”
</div>
<p>
    15 years later
</p>
<p>
    Will Stevenson:
</p>
<div>
    It’s been fifteen years and they haven’t found Amanda. Of course, we are sad, who wouldn’t be? We were the parents of a sweet little girl. The cops said that they would find her, it never happened though. I knew it would never happen. After we stopped worrying about Amanda, we changed her room. We didn’t want to remember her. We didn’t want to feel guilty about losing our daughter.
</div>
<div>
    “Hon, can you get the phone?” my wife said. She was in the laundry room. The phone was next to me. So, I took it.
</div>
<div>
    “Hello?” When I picked up the phone I always said hey or hello in a questioning tone. It didn’t matter if I knew who it was, when I picked up the phone I always said hello that way.
</div>
<div>
    “Hi, is this the Stevenson’s?” the person on the phone said. I didn’t recognize the voice.
</div>
<div>
    “Uhh, yes mam. This is Will Stevenson you are speaking with at the moment”, I replied. It felt as if I knew the person on the phone but I didn’t recognize the voice. I knew for sure the person on the other side of the phone wasn’t from the neighborhood.
</div>
<div>
    “Is your wife, hold on, uhh here I have it as Darlene Stevenson, is she there too?” I wanted to badly say yes but I couldn’t.
</div>
<div>
    “Uh hold on let me call her.”
</div>
<div>
    “Yes, please take your time.”
</div>
<div>
    “DARLENE!” I yelled.
</div>
<div>
    “What hon” I always liked it when she called me hon. It was so cringy but cute. I loved it.
</div>
<div>
    “What hon” I always liked it when she called me hon. It was so cringy but cute. I loved it.
</div>
<div>
    “We got somebody on the phone wanting to talk to the both of us. So come here.” She came.
</div>
<div>
    “Ok, I’m here.” I put it on speaker.
</div>
<div>
    “Ok, mam you are on speakerphone. Both of us are here and listening.”
</div>
<div>
    “Ok, Darlene and Will Stevenson. My name is Amanda Stevenson. I am your daughter.” My hand was shaking. Darlene looked so worried. I was of course worried as well. We looked at the calendar it was August 15, 1999. Exactly 15 years since we filed a missing child report.
</div>
<div>
    “Hi, honey. How are you?” Darelene asked.
</div>
<div>
    “DON’T YOU ASK ME HOW I AM? I AM WELL, BUT YOU MONSTER!” My wife was shaking even more. I was shocked that my daughter could ever talk to her mom like this. “AND DAD. I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE EVER AGAIN. I KNOW EVERYTHING. YOU CAN NEVER HIDE IT.” I was completely shocked.
</div>
<div>
    “Honey we looked in your room this very morning 15 years ago and never saw you there. We then filed a police report. Who told you all this? Mom and I are worried about you”
</div>
<div>
    “YOU KNOW WHAT, I’M DONE. I’M DONE WITH THE BOTH OF YOU. I’M TOO MAD TO TALK TO THE BOTH OF YOU. GOODBYE!” Amanda was somewhere. Darlene sat down and cried. She had no clue what to do. I sat down with her and tried to comfort her. She was shocked that Amanda was alive. You could tell she did not like it one bit. 
</div>
<p>
    Darlene Stevenson:
</p>
<div>
    Will called me downstairs while I was doing the laundry. It had been the 15th anniversary since Amanda had gone missing. Will said something about a call and someone on the phone wanting to speak to the both of us. I went down and saw Will waiting for me. 
</div>
<div>
    “Ok, mam you are on speakerphone. Both of us are here and listening”, Will said.
</div>
<div>
    “Ok, Darlene and Will Stevenson. My name is Amanda Stevenson. I am your daughter.” I was so worried. Will’s hand was even shaking. It was 15 years since we had filed the missing child report.
</div>
<div>
    “Hi, honey. How are you?” I asked.
</div>
<div>
    “DON’T YOU ASK ME HOW I AM? I AM WELL, BUT YOU MONSTER!” After Amanda said that I was shaking even more than Will. “AND DAD. I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE EVER AGAIN. I KNOW EVERYTHING. YOU CAN NEVER HIDE IT.” Will looked completely shocked and scared.
</div>
<div>
    “Honey we looked in your room this very morning 15 years ago and never saw you there. We then filed a police report. Who told you all this. Mom and I are worried about you”, Will replied.
</div>
<div>
    “YOU KNOW WHAT, I’M DONE. I’M DONE WITH THE BOTH OF YOU. I’M TOO MAD TO TALK TO THE BOTH OF YOU. GOODBYE!” I sat down and started crying. Will sat down and tried to comfort me. It never worked though. I had never thought in a million years that we would ever get a call from the little girl that we had stabbed to death 15 years ago. Of course, we felt bad, but we didn’t want her anymore. We stabbed, dismembered her, and then threw her off of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge at night. Nobody found her. 
</div>
<div>
    I was scared. Who had we killed then? Who was in Amanda’s room that night? Who told her? Where is she? I had so many questions. I didn’t want Amanda to come back because she knew what happened, and she would tell the police. She was 25 now, she had to have a good sense of what the law was and what murder specifically was. She might even have a boyfriend or a husband, maybe even kids.
</div>
<div>
    “Hon, everything is gonna be alright.”
</div>
<div>
    “Really? Alright?”
</div>
<div>
    “Yes alright. She would never tell anyone.”
</div>
<div>
    “How do you know that? She found out our number. She is alive. Did you see the way she talked to us? We are gonna die in prison. We are never gonna live our lives in peace. We are gonna die.” I got so scared. I had never thought that this would ever happen to us. We were clueless as to how this could have happened.
</div>
<div>
    “Let’s find her.”
</div>
<div>
    “What do you mean?”
</div>
<div>
    “I mean let’s find her and finish the job.”
</div>
<div>
    “We could buy one of those phone trackers. Chances are that she already settled.”
</div>
<div>
    “Yeah, good idea. Finish the job. Loving it.” I felt really good about that idea. “We will call her back tomorrow.”
</div>
<div>
    No, knowing her. She might call back.”
</div>
<div>
    “Tomorrow?”
</div>
<div>
    “Yeah.”
</div>
<div>
    “We’ll track her.”
</div>
<div>
    “Okay.” After that, we went to bed. I knew she would call. Not because I had the gut feeling, but because Will had said so. I tried to go to sleep. I couldn’t. Just the thought of Amanda being alive haunted me. 
</div>
<div>
    “Hey, hon wake up. We gotta go see if she calls us”, Will said. He woke me up by nudging me. We came down had showered, had breakfast, and then check the phone. Sure enough, 10 missed calls. We called back. We turned on the tracking device and hoped she would reply and that we could track her.

</div>
<p>
    Amanda Stevenson:
</p>
<div>
    I ran away. I ran far from home, never thinking of coming back. Everyone viewed my dad as the best dad in the world, well spoiler alert, he wasn’t, isn’t, and never could have been. I mean if you can’t be a good parent, why would you have children. Watching them raise me has given me the best experience to raise my kids. It’s been about 15 years since I ran away. I ran to my best friend's, now husband's, house. His mom was the nicest. Only she understood what went on in my household 15 years ago. The hatred, the violence, the hardships, she knew it all. Ryan, my now husband, didn’t know anything but his mom, Jennifer, did. My parents did not know that she knew but, she did either way. She never talked to me in public about it but, when I ran away, I ran to her house. There, she asked me what happened. I told her that I had had enough of it and was running away. Jennifer told me that Ryan went to the mall with his friends. I didn’t mind, but I never thought that he ever kept his word. I knew he went to some girl’s house watching her sleep. That girl happened to be me that night. See, Ryan happened to have this crush on me and “stalked” me. He saw everything that happened that night. The night I ran away was a rainy day, and even the lights went out. Ryan saw a girl sneak in and thought it was me and decided to follow me. He stayed outside and watched as my parents murder a little stranger that had done no harm to them. He followed them and saw them chop her apart and throw her off of a bridge. He couldn’t tell which bridge. Jennifer told me all this the next day. Ryan was terrified and decided to never leave my side after that. When Jennifer told me all of this the next morning, I looked at Ryan and said sorry. He looked back and told me that he would never leave me and always would stay with me. We were only ten years of age when he said that. His mom looked at him amusingly and said that I should become a lawyer and prosecute them for murder. I did, and now I am a lawyer and could never have been prouder. I called the police and decided to tell them everything. I also told them about my plan. I knew my parents wanted to finish me and probably decide to kill me once and for all. They needed to track me for that. So I decided that I would go into an abandoned park and stay there for the call. The police would also be there.
</div>
<div>
    “Hello, honey.” My dad could be so galling sometimes.
</div>
<div>
    “Hey, dad,” I replied.
</div>
<div>
    “We want to see that beautiful face of yours.”
</div>
<div>
    “I don’t want you to see me, my husband, or any of my kids.” I heard something that resonated with ‘we got it’. I thought that they might have gotten my address. I knew that the second they got my address they would hang up to come and come to kill me, so I kept the phone on a little longer in case they needed more time.
</div>
<div>
    “K, honey me, and mom need to go. We will talk to you later.” I then knew that they had found me. I quickly got into the car and drove off to the park. I had told the officers everything beforehand. They were the ones that told me to call them first and see what happens. I called officers and told them that they had tracked me and I was at the park. 
</div>
<div>
    “Ok don’t worry we will be right there. Get out of sight and if they ever ask to see you there then take them to the lake.” The officers were there, so I knew they would take care of it. However, I had wanted to see them and their faces after they had gotten arrested. I got in the car. I stayed there for about 10 - 15 minutes and saw them step into the park. They had no clue what they had gotten themselves into. It was quite funny. It looked like they had a knife in their hands. The police were surrounding them. It was a swampy environment. It was obvious they had a hard time walking around. They then called me.
</div>
<div>
    “Hey hon, where are you right now. I want to see you. I won’t touch you. I won’t do anything. I just want to see you and maybe even talk to you.”
</div>
<div>
    “Hey Dad, I’m at the park.”
</div>
<div>
    “Where?”

</div>
<div>
    “By the lake.” After that, I hung up. I saw them cross the stream and walk near the lake. I knew they couldn’t see me, I also knew that they couldn’t see the cops.
</div>
<div>
    The cops then quietly snuck up on them and yelled “Hands up Darlene and Will Stevenson!”
</div>
<div>
     I barely heard anything after that, but I think it went something like “Let go of me bastards!”
</div>
<div>
    “You have no right over me!”
</div>
<div>
    Then the cops replied, “Well, we do for the next week.”
</div>
<div>
    My dad then said, “So you gonna let us go in a week?”
</div>
<div>
    “No, your daughter is gonna prosecute you!”
</div>
<div>
    I laughed and drove off. He was a total goner.
