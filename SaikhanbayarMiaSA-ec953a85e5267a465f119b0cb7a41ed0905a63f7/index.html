        <h1>THE BURNING POSSESSION</h1>
        <h2>(!) “~~~” means change of POV (!)</h2>
        <p>A raging windstorm whistled against the glass windows. The abyssal night---no movement heard or seen. Tick tock… Tick tock… Dung Dung! The wooden grand clock sang its hourly song signifying the time was indeed midnight.</p>
        <p>A young girl---no more than the age of ten---was sweeping the shabby diner’s marble floor. The girl’s sea-green eyes caught sight of something shining between the cushion of a chair. Curiosity enwrapped the young girl and her eyes led her to the source. The girl bent down and got on her knees. She stuck her arm between the chair and felt the dust tickling her arms. Her arm acted like a claw machine with no luck until---aha---finally something was in her grasp. She withdrew her arm and saw what it was: a silver necklace, thin and fragile.</p>
        <p>~~~</p>
        <p>The necklace was so alluring, so beautiful, I couldn’t take my eyes off of it. It was too precious to give away and my greed was too strong. I hurriedly swung the necklace around my neck and to hide the deed, I quickly placed the jewelry under my fuzzy maroon sweater. Before anyone could notice they had lost a necklace, I quickly finished sweeping the floors and returned home. To say the least, I felt satisfied---not in any way guilty. I felt a sense of power within myself---I thought of malicious intentions.</p>
        <p>~~~</p>
        <p>The next morning was the same as all others had been, nothing out of the ordinary. The girl’s parents were waiting for her in their ‘comfortable’ kitchen. The family wasn’t considered to be wealthy, they were comfortable in their current position.</p>
        <p>“Good morning, Grace. I prepared pancakes so hurry up and eat before it gets cold. Today is Saturday, so you can go out and play with your friends at the playground out front.” her mother said. She was a round woman with brunette hair and a warm smile.</p>
        <p>Grace’s step-father had greeted her as well. He was a tall, skinny man reaching over six feet and had dark eye-bags under his eyes due to a lack of sleep.</p>
        <p>The couple was deeply in love and aimed to raise Grace well. They hadn’t suspected anything from the night before and Grace was in a hurry to leave. She wasn’t the type to behave hurriedly, rather she would often take a while to leave. Her parents assumed she was excited for something and disregarded the sudden change in her ways.</p>
        <p>~~~</p>
        <p>I trudged creepily onto the playground and saw a group of children the same age as me---or the host. As I walked closer to the parents and their children, I began to lose a sense of the body. The right foot grew limb and I had to hop on one leg. The children soon noticed me and grew cautious. They tried to swat me away as if I was an annoying fly. I grew more and more irritated and leaped onto a blonde boy. He was shocked and near tears while his parents quickly reached their son. My grip strengthened and I wasn’t planning on letting go. Tighter… tighter… until he fell unconscious…</p>
        <p>I could hear the distant screams of the people watching yet I didn’t mind them at all. The show was just starting to get entertaining…</p>
        <p>Someone had grabbed me from behind and I could identify them as the girl’s father. The girl’s body was weak and I could only focus on the blonde boy for now. The man was going to be a treat for later...</p>
        <p>~~~</p>
        <p>What was Grace doing? She seemed like a girl who would never hurt anyone! I ran towards Grace and grimaced at the sight. The boy was eerily white and I had to pry Grace off the boy. I tried to pull her and had accidentally touched a necklace. The touch caused Grace’s attention to flicker away for just enough time for me to get her off.</p>
        <p>I hurriedly carried Grace as I apologized for my ‘daughter’ while giving no proper explanation. However, the neighbors weren’t interested, they all scrambled to their own homes and shut the doors.</p>
        <p>I entered my house with its blue paint peeling off and laid Grace on the empty dinner table that was closest to the door. I suspected that the necklace was the origin of the problem.</p>
        <p>“Lauren! Bring the ropes from the basement! Hurry!” I yelled while trying to keep Grace on the table. My wife ran as fast as she could manage, and came back after what felt like hours. Grace began to get up and I couldn’t hold her down any longer. Finally when Lauren arrived, we tied her legs and arms to each leg of the table.</p>
        <p>I took a deep breath and reached for the lock of the necklace behind her neck. When my fingers came in contact with the necklace, they were burning and I couldn’t manage for long. My love for Grace was stronger than the pain and I urged through. The lock wasn’t difficult to detach, therefore I finished the task in a matter of excruciating seconds.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Grace’s body went limp and the girl fell unconscious. I didn’t know what we should do other than pray and hope for the best. I left Lauren with Grace as I quickly got in my car to the nearest church which was 100 miles away. I gave them the necklace and told them my story. I didn’t stay for long as I rushed back home.</p>
        <p>For the following three days, there was no sign of movement. Each second passed and we died more and more inside.</p>
        <p>Finally Grace began to move her fingers and Lauren bolted towards her.</p>
        <p>“M-mom what h-happened? I don’t r-re-remember anything from the p-p-past few d-days.” Grace trembled.</p>
        <p>“Everything is fine now, sweetie. I am glad you are with us now.” Lauren said as she pacified Grace with comforting words while cradling her. A river full of tears flooded the house and all I could do was stare. I couldn’t process what happened and I kept thinking, everything is fine until the necklace finds a new host.</p>
