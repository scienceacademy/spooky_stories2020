      <h2 class="title">The Ghost That Lingers Within</h2>
<p> It was a nice warm morning on October 30, the sun had just rose, the rooster was squealing, and the family had just come down stairs for breakfast. School starts at 8:00am, so the kids would be leaving soon, it was time for me to create my plan for tomorrow. I would start by moving around all of the furniture and household items in their house to make them feel suspicious of something being wrong. 
<p> The mom and father both had left for work soon after the kids, so I had the entire house to myself. I would need to ensure that the youngest of the family (the daughter) didn’t see me, because it seemed that every year when I would strike for some Halloween fun she would see me. I don’t know how or why this is possible, but it is, she could see ghosts! Out of the blue she would run to her parents and whisper “He’s looking at us right now,” and I would be amazed, like how is she doing this. So this year if I really want some spooky fun I will need to try my best to dodge her. It was now 2:00pm and the kids had just arrived home off of the bus, it was to their surprise that everything in their house had been tampered with and moved.
<p>
 Droors pulled out, kitchen rags all over the house, plates and knives all spread out around the table, some lights on some off, and a small little note on the table that said “Boy oh boy, is tomorrow going to be a fun one.” The kid’s faces turned bright red as they read the note, and their parents weren’t home so there was nothing for the poor children to do  than hug each other. I sat at a chair smirking as the two kids trembled in fear, it was all for fun as I’m not going to hurt anyone. Soon later that evening their parents arrived back home along with the daughter, and boy the story the kids had to tell their parents. As the parents saw, the house was indeed a mess due to what I had done. However, the parents didn;t seem fazed, they went on with their night as if nothing had happened to the house and the story their kids told them was fake. They had spaghetti for dinner, but when the family was having dinner I continued to toy with the kids, moving their cutlery around when the parents weren’t looking, and slightly adjusting the plate. After the children finished dinner they went immediately to bed, I figured I would let them have a peaceful night. It was now the next morning and the kids had all gotten up early, there was no school due to the festivity. The kids had breakfast with their parents right before they left for work, it was now just me and the kids. They all sat on the sofa watching tv, they sat side-by-side wrapped  in a blanket, now the fun shall begin. I started by flying through each child sending a tingling sensation through their bodies and raising the hair on their arms. They all nervously looked at eachother, “What was that”, they all said in unison, I then started to make creaking noises near the front door. The fear in their eyes filled my transparent heart with joy, I toyed and played with them for several more hours. This was until the youngest one said “Look, right there, the voice is floating right there.” They then began to pick up household items and hit me with them how foolish I can’t be hurt. “OOF”, a candle stick was flung at my face and I could feel it, how could this be, nothing like this had ever happened before. I had to run, I had to hide, as I was the one who was now endanger. I flew up and hid on the roof for a while, until I felt I was ready to go back into the house. The clock struck 5 o’clock and I knew it was time for me to strike, I slowly approached the front door and took the kids one by one, and took them back to my hideout.
