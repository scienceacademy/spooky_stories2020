    <title> Spoopy Story</title>
    <h1> Forest Ranger </h1>
    <p>
I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service; I have a story to tell. I have a pretty good track record for finding missing people. Most of the time they just wander off the path, or slip down a small cliff, and they can't find their way back. The majority of them have heard the old 'stay where you are' thing, and they don't wander far. But there was one case where that didn't happen. It was Saturday at 9:00 pm when I got the call. We were pretty busy as it was peak time of the week for people to go out, especially in the summer. The forest that I work at has a bit of a legend going on within the Search and Rescue team that certain “chosen people” disappear and get sortta absorbed into the forest as spirits. I've always taken it as an old wives’ tale but it can ease the load off of people that have lost close friends and or family in the forest. I got off my post and went to the report center where we got all of our information. It was a 9 year old girl and she got lost in the southeast sector of these specific woods, allegedly disappearing after her parents went to a river for a rest. I packed my stuff and started walking to the last reported sighting of the girl. It was almost pitch black by the time I got there, but I brought flashlights to guide me. It was pretty warm for the night and I decided to take off my sweater and enjoy the air. Our site that I work on is amazing, with lots of wildlife and natural rivers, the air having a distinct smell of pine trees. I could totally imagine putting up shop here and living off of the land. I started standard procedure by calling out for her in all directions just in case she could call back but unfortunately she did not and I had to do some dirty work. I had a buzz on my radio and central control (CC) said, “Bzzt, The rest of the Search and Rescue crew have done a circle around the southeast sector, start moving into the center. Over.”
</p>
    <p>
    “Copy, any clues to what happened to the girl? Over.” I responded.
</p>
    <p>
    “Not a trace, hope we can find her, but I bet we can with our crew. Over.”
</p>
    <p>
    Our crew is pretty good but CC always says we have the best Search and Rescue team. Closing in on the center of the sector is actually pretty convenient as I am pretty close to the center compared to some of the other groups.

    Something is off, VERY off. I have been walking for quite a while now and I haven't seen any of the other Search and Rescue groups, we sent out 6 or 7 and we are all walking to one point so it would be statistically improbable for me to not see anyone, not even their flashlights. I try to talk to CC about this but my radio is not working, guess I can't get a signal from this deep in the woods. The trees are getting closer together and some fog is rolling in, even though it is in the middle of the summer and fog doesn't usually occur now. Everything is quiet and the only things I can hear are my own footsteps and my heartbeat. I soldier on though because if I didn't have some balls I would have probably become a software engineer back in college instead of this. It suddenly gets a little cold as the forest widens into a clearing. There, in the middle of the clearing sits a staircase. Old and battered, made from willow and nothing at the top. I have never seen this ever in my 5 year career of being a Search and Rescue officer. But that wasn't the most terrifying thing. She was there. Oh boy when I saw her my skin crawled. When I first saw her she was halfway up the stairs staring into my soul. When she first spoke, it wasn't a 9 year old, she sounded like a 50 year old woman, and it was spine-chilling. 
</p>
    <p>
“Hello Adam, I have been waiting.” She boomed. How did she know my name? I have never met this girl in my life!
</p>
    <p>
    “H-Hello. I am Adam from Search and Rescue and I am here to take you home,” I shakily responded.
</p>
    <p>
    “No need. You know what? You can come with me on my little adventure.”
</p>
    <p>
    “I’m serious. Come with me so you can come back with your Mother.”
</p>
    <p>
     “Fine. I shall do my little journey by myself.” She stated and she waltzed up the stairs. As she walked, she changed. I don't know how to put it but it was reminiscent of nature, like natural selection happening at a lightning pace. I had to race after her but before I could stop her, she walked to the top and with my momentum I reached the top as well. 
</p>

   There was a flash, then a voice came to me. It was the same voice as the girl but this time I recognised it. It was the voice of the founder of the forest. The person who had originally petitioned to protect this land. She disappeared in the same area when she was 50. It was just a cackle then suddenly, I was weightless, like a ghost, and could see the whole forest and move throughout it. I saw the girl too, and others that had also disappeared. It's like they were assimilated. It was like I was assimilated. We were one with the forest. There was no going back, and we were all guardians of the forest.
