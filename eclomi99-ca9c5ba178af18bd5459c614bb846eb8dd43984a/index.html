        <h1>I Can't Be Replaced</h1>

            Many people have traumatic experiences throughout their lives. I probably have experienced one that most have not. Hi, I’m Damien Ichabod, a regular 14-year-old that almost lost my life to myself. Now let me explain. This sounds all corny at first but let me get into the details of what happened during Halloween in 2020, the year of the coronavirus. I was just a normal high school boy during quarantine, well, maybe not so normal now that I think of it. I was normal in most aspects; I did online learning, had friends, played video games, and played sports, but I was spoiled and didn’t love my family one bit. I remember when I felt so entitled to everything, and I was an ungrateful and unthankful narcissist. I was spoiled and got everything I wanted, but I didn’t ever truly love my parents and family members and instead spent time with friends. I have regretted this ever since...the incident.
        <br>
        <br>
            One day, after I had finished my homework and eaten dinner, I told my parents I was going upstairs to get ready to go to sleep. I showered, put on my pajamas, and started to brush my teeth. As I was scrubbing my teeth and looking through Instagram, I heard a knock at the front foor. I looked up from my phone and heard my dad say, “I got it.”
        <br>
        <br>
            This was a relief because I was getting ready to post a story, and I was a lazy creature by habit. After I finished brushing my teeth and gargling mouth wash, I did my usual self-admiration and stared at my reflection in the mirror. I did some poses and gestures when I saw that my reflection didn’t move at all. It was frozen in my hands-on-hips pose and when I looked closer in bewilderment, my reflection charged towards me and made me fall back. I was freaking out and started to run down the stairs to alert my parents when I realized that my shadow wasn’t doing what it was supposed to.  I ran down two stories of our mansion, my shadow making leaps in an attempt to try and tackle me like a football player. I ran faster than I ever did before and arrived out of breath on the first floor. My parents were eating dinner.
        <br>
        <br>
            “Dad, dad, dad. I need to tell you something really crazy.”
        <br>
        <br>
            “What, that you want the Call of Duty: Cold War battle pass like you got for all of the other games?” my dad replied carelessly.
        <br>
        <br>
            “No, Dad. It’s something realistic. I think my shadow and reflection came to life and it’s just really crazy. Can you believe it?” I explained.
        <br>
        <br>
            “Sure, I believe it. Now, you are a 14-year-old boy in 9th grade and you think that I would believe such blether? Now go to your room and just do whatever you do these days.” my dad retorted annoyingly.
        <br>
        <br>
            “Mom, what do you think about this?” I asked hopefully.
        <br>
        <br>
            “Same as your dad,” she replied.
        <br>
        <br>
            Upset with the outcome of my ‘efforts’, I ran back up our winding staircase and went to my room. I was confused by why my parents seemed to not care at all about what I told them until I realized that my whole life, I had not cared for them or shown any love but just asked for things that I wanted. I decided to try and see if I was just being delusional about this whole situation and went to my bathroom. I made movements in front of my mirror and my reflection did what I did. I breathed a sigh of relief and lay on my bed. I then tried to see if my shadow was normal and I made some shadow animals with my hands in front of my flashlight. I made a wolf, but to my horror, the shadow made a symbol of a gun and held a knife. It then made shooting and stabbing motions. I turned off the flashlight and looked towards the window and my reflection made a “your-dead” gesture by pretending to slit its throat and by this time, I was absolutely horrified.
        <br>
        <br>
            Then, I see my reflection jump out of the mirror and my shadow rise from the ground. They come next to each other, backing me towards my wall. My reflection was holding the knife as it was earlier and my shadow expanded in size, becoming all-consuming darkness and filling my room with pitch-black. I was frozen in fear when I saw my reflection staring back at me. I started to run but made no progress. I tried to yell but there was no sound. There was nothing that I could do as my reflection slowly made its way towards me with its knife. I yelled for my parents and for all of this to go away, and that I would never ever again take something for granted and that I would spend more memorable time with my parents. I passed out from the stress and exhaustion.
        <br>
        <br>
            When I woke up, I was covered in sweat. I looked around for any sign of my reflection or shadow but there was nothing. I looked outside the window and it appeared to be early morning. I went downstairs and saw my parents. I ran towards them and gave them hugs like I never had before. I told them I was sorry for everything and that I loved them, and I wanted to spend more time with them. For the rest of the day, we went to places and spent time together. I hadn’t checked or used any of my electronic devices the whole day. I felt like a new door had been opened for the first time in my life. After the day was over, I went to my bed and got ready to sleep. A weight of guilt had been lifted off of my shoulders and I went to sleep happily for the first time.
        <br>
        <br>
            The next morning, I got ready and came downstairs to meet my parents with a smile. I greeted them “good morning” and went to our table to eat breakfast. My dad was leaving to go to his office and right before he left, I went to give him a hug. I went over to the doorway and embraced my dad with the new love that I now possessed. I then looked towards the mega-mirror we had by the entrance door and saw a completely new person. Then, I saw myself make a sinister grin and make a “come-over-here” motion with its finger. I forgot all of the happiness that I had just felt and ran for my life. I ran outside the door but it was very dark. I turned to see my parents looking back sullenly and waving goodbye. Then, the darkness came back and I couldn’t see a thing.
        <br>

            Somewhere in the shadows of darkness, was the pounding of Damien Ichabod, begging to be freed. Damien was trapped forever, in the realm where hell was considered heaven, and where eternal darkness and silence were the only things you would know for the rest of eternity. Next time you look in the mirror or see a reflection of yourself, looking back...know we’re coming.
