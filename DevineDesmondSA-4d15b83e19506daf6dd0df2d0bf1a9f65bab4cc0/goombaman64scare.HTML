        <hr>
        <hr>
        <hr>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a small village, dilapidated buildings sat like nails protruding from a board. The grass was black and dead. Only one tree was present on the scene, and it too was on the verge of death. Several dim lamps sat next to countless roads, where many a merchant used to roam, selling their wares to the villagers exiting their once beautiful houses. They were all abandoned no less than ten years ago, and all that proved the site used to be habitable was an old, crumbling well. It had always been a miracle to the people of the village. Without the faithful well, the villagers would die of thirst within days. The sun was cruel, and any rain that would by chance fall from the sky was quickly evaporated. Despite the help the well provided, it was also the reason why the village was deserted. There, inside the well, was a living blight to the people. Inside the well, was a monster. It, without being noticed by any soul, poisoned the water with an uncurable neurotoxin that killed and drove several mad. These corrupted, insane induviduals would commit further bloodshed across the land. They too had to be slain for their own sake. The survivors had all ran to other villages and cities, scared to make the long journey. Many would not survive their forced pilgrimage. Today, all fear of the well had vanished with those who had been directly affected by its malady.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, on a seemingly normal afternoon, in a foundation a few score miles away from the cursed well, a commoner had taken a sip from the clearest river and then came to a luncheon with his friends. Midway through their festivities, the man grew angry. Ranting of unknown gibberish, he was brought to an asylum. No matter what cure was given, the man consistently raved and grew violent with words and actions. In the weeks that followed, several other incidents happened. A woman too decided to drink from the river. A group of children swam and play during afterschool hours. Even animals had disturbing symptoms when coming into contact with the river waters. Investigators analyzed that the river's source... was from the well. More people had to move, and the investigators had mild symptoms after using gloves to touch the infected water. One was in a coma for four days. However, seven villagers remained in the village. Seven clever, insightful, and wise people knew that the infection would slowly spread far and wide until it met the ocean, and then it would become unstoppable. Forensic teams saw spores in the water, and believed them to be the source of the madness. To stop it, the seven brave souls would have to destroy the plague at the source. They were travelling to the well. With protective suits fit for astronauts in deep space, the group set out on what others would call a suicide mission.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The journey was long and tiresome. Eating and drinking was done on pieces of land far away from natural water. The travellers slept in their suits for fear of waves of water surrounding them. For most of the journey, things were bright. On the sixth day, John was thirsty. His canteen was empty, and the water purifier would take another nine hours to produce sporeless refills. However, John spotted a spring that noone else could see. Fish swam happily. A few trees swayed in the cool breeze. It was an oasis, and because of life, there was no way the water could be toxic. It seemed so appealing to John. A voice in his head called and guided him to the water. From eight feet away, John relaxed and closed his eyes, ready for the taste of relief. "JOHN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" Shouted Sarah, another member of the group. Speechless, John opened his eyes and discovered that he was on the pondside, his hand mere inches away from the water. "ARE YOU CRAZY? WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WATER'S GOOD OR NOT!" John quickly backed away and let out a small cough. Still feeling thirsty, he sadly ventured away from the oasis. "Sarah, what do you think he was at?" said Hannah, who looked deeply worried. Sarah shrugged and glanced at John. The infection corrupted souls from a few hours to a few days from the point of contact. John looked normal. Almost too normal. "He looked like he saw a ghost. You caught him just in time, and there is no way he could've touched that water. His hand was dry!" Sarah decided to calm down. After all, John was too smart to touch natural water. Was he?</p>
        <br>
        <p>On the group's tenth day across the arid desert surrounding the village, Carl, the most observant member of the group, noticed drastic changes in the landscape. There were fewer plants. Corpses of bugs were common. The only live animals seen were birds flying overhead, away from the group's destination. An eerie feeling consumed them. Many claimed they heard voices and faint screams. Sarah said the voices were imaginary and if the concentrate on other things, they would go away. Only Andy heard voices after that, but he didn't dare to speak. "The village is on the horizon" said Carl, noticing a few ruined houses and a collapsed streetlight far off into the distance. The group built their quarantine tent, had a quick supper, and went to sleep. Tomorrow, the group would have to brave whatever hid in the cursed well. The members took long to fall asleep, and some shuddered, having unpleasant thoughts about the expedition soon coming to them. Eventually, all members but John fell asleep. He stood in the darkness, looking towards the village. <i>"Why not get a closer look?"</i> he thought. Slowly, without making a sound, John crept from the tent and went towards the village. There was no grass, dead trees, and polluted air. He kicked a pebble into a puddle of water. It was milky and had a slimy texture. The pebble fell slowly into the water and John looked towards the cursed well. He returned to the tent, thinking about what scourge lay underground.</p>
        <p style="color: #050505">He could almost see it...</p>
        <p>The group woke and had a brief breakfast of energy bars. Sarah then took a head count: everyone was present. She then called the members to head out and search the village for evidence. If they could find clues on how the blight could be stopped, then the group wouldn't need to risk going into the well. They split up in four smaller teams: Carl and Mack, Andy and Henry, and Sarah, Hannah, and John. Sarah put John with her and Hannah so they could keep a close watch on him. He was suspicious, so an eye on him prevented any incidents. Little discoveries were made other than a few skeletons and moldy belongings. However, at 2:48 PM, Henry made a big announcement: "EVERYBODY COME HERE! I'VE FOUND A SCIENTIFIC DOCUMENT ON THE BLIGHT! GUYS! COME ON!". Quickly everybody ran to where Henry stood. Andy was nearby, searching through a restaurant. Hannah took the paper, and read it aloud; "I have liven through this blight long enough. I have done my research, and have nearly infected myself. There is a way to defeat the monster." What followed was a sequence of equations and statistics. Then, it said: "According to my data, the monster is weak to acid. It has infected countless trees, but the ripe lemon fruits it does not touch. If we could just get to the resovoir in Cou-" The page was ripped. Henry was confused. When he first saw it, it had been a little soggy, but pretty much undamaged. All eyes went to John. He could've swiped it! John emptied his pockets, and had nothing inside. "Guess in my reverie of finding something useful, my mind blurred things a little", Henry said. The group searched longer for evidence, but found no more. Tomorrow, their fears will be faced and the well would be explored.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A makeshift ladder was thrown into the well by Mack, who was proficient with crafts and architecture. The members slowly descended the ladder, with John being the last to arrive at the bottom. He shuddered and murmured, scared. All the other members of the group also felt quivery, but they managed to stay calm. The bottom of the well had a small stream of water flowing near their feet, and rotting earth was piled up on the walls of the chasm. There seemed to be pathways, with water flowing in each of them. "This must be how the water infects lands. Slow and steady", Hannah remarked. The source apparently wasn't directly underneath the well, so Carl, Andy, and Mack travelled in the direction opposite from the way it was flowing. Sarah took John and searched in the other passages, hoping to find more evidence. Hannah and Henry decided that they should go to the surface and look for lemons, the monster's only weakness. Sarah encountered many skeletons and maps. She heard and disregarded odd noises as she picked up a map. Then without warning. a shadow emerged from a passage several yards away from John. John stayed put, frozen in fear, but Sarah ran. She heard pounding feet, and they grew silent. Then, out of nowhere, a figure erupted from the moldy ground. Sarah fell to the ground, stunned. Meanwhile, the trio searching for the source thought they heard screams. Mack was busy making a map of the tunnels, but he noticed the sound. "Was that one of our own?" He said. The other members thought it was just the sound of bats, so they unknowingly pressed on.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sarah awoke minutes later on a stone block, still wearing her protective suit. There was no sign of infection. She called out for the other members, but she was too far away from them to hear. She looked for John, but he was gone, possibly taken to another site. Where she was, a crevice filled with bones and emerging bulbs of some kind of plant. She remembered the documents about fungus. If she didn't wake up, she would've probably gotten infected. Not wanting to meet the monster again, Sarah left the cave where she was and started looking for her partners. What was that thing, though? It resembled a human, but covered in soil and stones, with bulbous growths accumulating on the surface. It had no face and no arms, and several crablike appendages for legs. It moved oddly, like a huge zombie with jelly legs. Mutilated mounds of flesh could be seen beneath, and Sarah knew the calls she and the other members have heard. The monster was an infected human! There could be more, too. Hundreds of people had been caught in the blight, but none that she knew of made it inside the well. It was most likely patient zero: the most corrupted soul of them all. Sarah moved quickly and froze and hid whenever she heard a noise or voices. Finally she made contact with Carl, and told him everything about what she encountered. Carl ran off to alert the other group members, and from now on, they would be a lot more paranoid.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Meanwhile, on the surface, Hannah travelled away from the village in search of lemon trees. The document said the nearest one was about 3.4 miles east. Under the blistering sun, everything was lifeless. "I hope these lemons aren't dehydrated" said Henry. Hannah nodded and replied, "I hope we don't get dehydrated". The water purifier barely contained any liquid and their canteens were hollow and empty. The duo kept on, getting thirstier and thirstier. A puddle gradually getting soaked up by the Earth was found a few minutes later and the water purifier would take two hours to get rid of all particles. Henry thought that they wouldn't die of thirst if they had water. 3.4 miles wasn't that much. Then, when it seemed that the duo had travelled the wrong way, an oasis appeared. It had two trees, with ripe lemons dangling from the tops. Relieved, the duo ran toward the oasis, ready to fill up the water purifier and take the cure back to their comrades in the well. However, right before Henry's foot reached the nearly colorless grass, the ground rumbled and stirred. Hannah fell over as a twisted figure came forth slowly from the ground. The monster that once captured Sarah was there right in front of the exasperated duo. It shifted and changed appearance, going from a mutilated arachnid to a long zombified worm. The monster roared and dived at Henry. He took his canteen and struck the monster, removing bits of stone and flesh. But, the worm spat water at him and, struggling to remove it, Henry dropped his weapon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bracing himself, Henry prepared to get crushed by the rocky serpent surrounding him. He looked at Hannah, who tried to distract the monster by hitting it with her canteen. The monster unexpectadly moved its tail and hit Hannah on the side, and she flew, landing near the pond in the oasis. Henry closed his eyes, and the monster let out a bloodcurdling screech. A pale liquid dripped from its head and the wiggling worm flailed madly, trying to remove the searing substance. Henry looked up, and saw the monster retreating! Looking to his left, he saw Hannah, who was clutching half of a cut lemon. No wonder the monster slithered off! Henry thanked Hannah and looked back at the monster, watching it settle and wither. But, instead of dying, it grew, sediment accumulating around it. It burrowed into the ground, and reemerged as a tall golem with huge teeth. "RUN!" said Hannah. The duo gathered as many lemons as they could hold and sprinted away from the oasis, with the monster in close pursuit. Hannah threw the juiceless lemon half in the monsters path, hoping to delay it. Instead, it slipped, and fell mere feet away from the duo. Stunned, the golem rolled into a river. Angry and tired, the golem transformed back into a worm and dived into the earth, never to be seen again on the surface. The duo slowed their run and looked back. The golem disappeared. Happy with the outcome, the duo walked slowly to the village, ready to stop the scourge once and for all.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Returning to the well, Henry took a drink of water and called out to the other members of the group. "SARAAAAH! MAAACK! AAANDYY! CAAARL!" he called out. A few minutes later, Mack emerged from a passage. "Guys! We've discovered the source." Mack said. "You guys got the lemons?" Hannah and Henry nodded. "Good. come on!" Mack replied. After a short walk, Mack came to a large chamber with moldy floors and more bolbous growths. Setting up a makeshift table, Mack and the others sliced the lemons and prepared to squeeze the juice onto the growths. Andy also made a brilliant desicion to dig through the earth. Andy unearthed a huge, heartlike mound of mycelium. It pulsed and tried to spread itself among the floor. Carl prodded it with a stick and the heart stopped moving. The group members looked at each other, knowing they had indeed found the source. They prepared to dump the lemon juice on the heart, when Carl let out a horrible scream. Looking at their comrade, the group members almost dropped the juice in horror. Carl was in the hands of the monster, who took the shape of a large ogre or troll. The monster killed him, turning him into a bloody, mutilated corpse. The monster was about to catch the other members of the group when Andy kicked the lemon juice directly on the heart. The monster shrieked, writhing and falling apart. The rocks that making up the beast fell to the ground, the mass of flesh underneath revealing itself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Looking at the heart, the group members cheered. The blight was over! The members could live without fear! "We've done it! Now let's go home!" Said Sarah, filled with joy. "YOU WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE." Said a dark, robotic voice. A figure emerged from the shadows, growths and vines of mycelium covering it. "John?" the group members said at the same time. "YES IT IS ME. YOU HAVE BEEN TRICKED. ACIDS MOMENTARILY DAMAGE MASTER, BUT THEY MAKE MASTER STRONGER AS IMMUNITY INCREASES. MASTER INFECTS HUMANS TO BECOME SUPERIOR, AND ONLY HUMANS HAVE THE MIND POWER MASTER DESIRES, AND MASTER FINALLY GRIPPED SOMEBODY STRONG ENOUGH TO CONTROL YOU ALL. YES, JOHN RIPPED THE DOCUMENT. HE KNEW ONE PART EXPLAINED THE RISK OF ACID, AND REMOVED IT. THE VOICES GUIDED YOU WITHOUT YOU KNOWING, AND NOW MASTER WILL THANK YOU, FOR MASTER CANNOT PENETRATE THE SKIN OF LEMONS ON HIS OWN. FAREWELL". John fell to the ground. The group members were about to run when a few rocks moved around John, Carl, and the fleshy mound. Creating a more gruesome and powerful monster, the lemon juice allowed "master" to make stronger creations. The beast did not attack, but created a wall surrounding all exits. Hannah almost escaped, but tendrils erupting from the monster impaled her, killing her. Water started spurting from the heart, filling the chamber. The members struggled for air, but there was no way out of the chamber. After they drowned, the monster disintegrated, allowing water to flow through the chambers faster and stronger than before. Water even erupted from the well, covering several miles. Several days later, water covered thousands of square miles, ravaging villages and castles. Beneath the surface, several golems dug more tunnels and wells reaching the surface. Then, at least a week after the group members were killed, a golem unearthed a giant chasm of water, knowing that master would use it to conquer more land. The golem remarked that the water was salty, unlike anything he had ever tasted!</p>
