                    “Jacob Green, get up we’re already here” a muffled voice said.
                
                    I opened my eyes slowly squinting as the sun shone brightly on my face. I got out of the car slouching as I
                still felt sluggish. I hadn’t really wanted to go on this camping trip, but my two friends, Jonathan Red (He’s 11 years 
                old) and Joshua blue (He’s 14; same age as me), had hauled me here with them against my will. With the humid 
                atmosphere and bug filled land, camping is not my favorite thing to do, but it seemed somewhat captivating.
                
                “Hey Jacob, help me take these things out of the car, will ya’? ” my father called.
                
                    After several hours of trying to set everything up nightfall was slowly commencing, and it was time to enter our tents.
                Arranging our sleeping bags, Jonathan suddenly speaks up.
                
                    “Do you guys know about the strange rumor about a dark spirit meandering around this forest?” Jonathan asked in an 
                    ominous tone.
                
                    Both Joshua and I had no clue on what Jonathan was talking about, so we listened in closely.
                
                    “It was said that a man was taking a nap in this forest and he was awakened to some kids who tied him up against a tree, 
                “Jonathan said as the light seemed to grow darker, “The man yelled to release him, but the kids just scurried away leaving 
                him immobile on the tree.”
                
                    “Did the kids come back at least? ” asked Joshua.
                
                    “No, they left him stranded in the depths of the woods until he ultimately died of starvation, “ replied Jonathan, “People 
                suspect that his soul had manifested into a dark, hazy spirit, who hunts for wandering children, and then devours them as 
                he feeds his hunger for revenge.”
                
                    Joshua and I looked at each other in disbelief on how Jonathan’s miniature mind even concocted this idea.
                
                    “That’s a nice story, Jonathan, but spirits aren’t real,” I said congratulating him for making this interesting tale.
                
                    As Johnathan tried to coerce us into believing that it was actually legitimate, we decided to go for a late night hike to 
                immerse ourselves in the feeling of camping. The fall leaves and breeze created a gentle mood and the trees presented us 
                with the most refreshing air. 
                
                    “Maybe camping isn’t so bad, “ I said walking around.
                
                    As an hour passed, it was starting to get really dark, so we decided to return to the campsite. Along the way I heard a 
                mysterious, low growling coming from down the hill next to us. Trying to locate where the sound was originating, 
                I stepped near the edge. 
                
                    “What are you doing Jacob, that's dangerous,” said Joshua.
                
                    “I’ll be fine,” I replied, “I just thought I heard something; something like a deep gro--”
