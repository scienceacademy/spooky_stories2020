                    The last thing I heard from my friends were them crying out my name. After tumbling down the 
                leaf-covered hill, I had come to a halt finally near a dreary stream flowing downward. I tried to stand up, only to 
                wince in pain as a sharp aching was produced in my right leg. I must’ve broken a bone from falling. Abruptly, I 
                heard the distinct growling again. I looked around to meet the eyes of a strange figure staring directly at me from a 
                distance.
                
                “Hello! Can you please help me, I accidentally fell down here from the top of the hill!” I asked the figure.
            
                    Confused on why the person was not doing anything, I started to look at the figure more deeply. It had a 
                bizarre body made of dark, staticky fog that seemed to absorb the light around it. Its face was empty except for two 
                wide, bright eyes and a smile that was abnormally stretched.
                
                .... All at once, an immense surge of panic suffocated me as I realized, ‘That thing isn’t human’. I got up and tried to 
                run as fast as I could, the pain of my leg flowing through me. The hazy spirit started to approach me as I tried to run 
                away. It was coming closer and closer, faster and faster! 
            
                    “JONATHAN! JOSHUA! HELP ME PLEASE!” I screeched at the top of my lungs.
            
                    No response from my two friends could be heard. I was only answered with the low growling that the spirit 
                was emanating. The growling was coming louder and louder by the second, and I didn’t dare to look back; I didn’t 
                want to believe that this was happening. The spirit was radiating that it was the embodiment of fear; that it 
                was the symbol of dread. I knew I couldn’t stop moving, I knew if I did I would surely die! ... Suddenly, I felt an 
                unbearable twinge in my leg. ...  My leg had betrayed me and given up. I collapsed and landed in the stinging cold 
                stream next to me. I began to wish that the stream would freeze me as I glanced back to see the bloodshot eyes and 
                petrifying smile of the spirit mere feet away from me. 
            
                    “Stay away from me!” I yelled at the figure.
            
                    The figure completely disregarded any sounds I made. It stared directly into my soul, as if it was boring a 
                hole where my heart was. I desperately tried to get up and find an escape, but it was of no use. My leg would not 
                obey me, waiting for me to die. The figure came closer and closer, its growling becoming louder and louder I felt 
                like it was laughing at me; cackling at me for being so foolish. It opened its mouth revealing thousands of teeth 
                awaiting my life. 
            
                    I screamed with all of my life,  “I DON’T WANT TO DIE LIKE THIS, I CAN’T DIE LIKE THIS!” 
            
                    I released a final shriek as its mouth started to enclose on my face.
            
            
                    ....“-ob. acob-. Jacob!” Joshua screamed as he shook me awake.
            
                    “Are you alright, man? You fell unconscious when you plunged down the hill!” said Johnathan.
            
                    “W-what happened to the shadowy spirit?” I questioned, “It almost killed me!”
            
                    “What spirit?” Joshua and Johnathan said as they both looked at me questioningly, “Don’t tell me you had a 
                nightmare about the spirit you said explicitly wasn’t real.” 
            
                    As I grew more confused and irritated by my friends for laughing about the situation I just went through, I 
                began to feel relieved that the whole thing was really illegitimate. My friends helped me up as we started to go back 
                to our campsite and I was lectured on how I really should be taking precautions. ... But, unknowingly to me a low 
                growling was dispersing quietly throughout the dark woods; a low growling that was emanating from a pair of wide, 
                bloodshot eyes and a stretched smile filled with thousands of teeth.
