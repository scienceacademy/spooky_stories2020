<p>     It was an ordinary Halloween night, kids trick or treating, each finding enough candy to feed them for years to come. Jacob, Josh, and Adam were similar to any ordinary teenagers. They played video games, got decent grades, and always found a way to steer from trouble. While roaming the streets, their goal for the night was to pull of the biggest Halloween prank of all time, which was supposedly thought to be toilet papering the Mayor’s house. Once they finally arrived, they started throwing toilet paper, and didn’t stop until the entire house was covered. While they were finishing up, the cops spotted them, and a chase began.<p>
<p>     The kids got on their bikes, and started pedaling as fast as their skinny legs could. Knowing they wouldn’t outrun the cops, they quickly pulled up to a house which they thought was abandoned, but they were terribly wrong. The house was dark as the sky, with old nails sticking out of the floors. As they entered the house, they heard the sirens of the police pass by, showing that they had lost them. As Jacob slowly stood back up, the door to the mansion shut, and a variety of candles were lit. At first, the boys just thought it was a prank, and that this was just a Haunted House being run by some 20 year old, so they started dancing, singing, and taunting the house. Slowly after, a mirror appeared in front of them, which read, to get out alive, you must leave one behind. All of a sudden, the floor began to shake, and all glass in the house began to shatter. A pair of hands broke through the floor, and grabbed Adam’s legs. A beast which looked like a mix of a clown, a bat, and a blobfish, began to walk towards the kids. Josh picked up a coat rack, and started waking the beast. Two vines slowly dropped down from the roof, and wrapped around Jacob’s arms. Jacob was risen up, and the boys could no longer see him. Adam on the other hand, was pulled down, beneath the floor, by the green, devilish hands that had grabbed him. Josh was left in the entrance, and had no escape from the beast, which  devoured him, limb by limb, until there was nothing left. The boys heard his faint screams for a few seconds, until complete silence was all that remained.<p>
<p>     Now that Jacob had been pulled to the upper level of the house, he found himself wandering around, looking for a stair case. Though this seemed simple, it wasn’t, because every step he took, a hand reached out of the wall, trying to grab him. Meanwhile, Adam was wandering around the basement of the house, when he say a black, devilish, horrifying spider. It was 8 feet tall, and started chasing after Adam. It caught up with him, and not having the ability to eathim, just bit off his arm. After finally escaping to the upstairs entrance, Adam cried tears of death, wanting the pain to end. Jacob finally arrived at the entrance, meeting up with Adam.  The door was locked shut, and they had no idea how they’d get out. Then, Adam remembered, to get out alive, you must leave one behind. Knowing he had to leave Jacob in order to escape, Adam was heartbroken, but knew what he had to do. Adam grabbed the sword which was being held by the replica soldier, and stabbed Jacob, right in the leg. With Jaob being unable to walk, the door opened, and Adam quickly ran outside. The door was then shut, and Adam looked through the window, to see what was about to happen to Jacob. Then, he heard a thumping noise, louder then you can ever imagine. The beast walked up behind Jacob, and devoured him. Adam ran home, not believing that his two closest friends had just died. With his arm in excruciating pain, and being covered in a coat of sadness because of his friends’ death’s, Adam walked up to his roof, and jumped.<p>
