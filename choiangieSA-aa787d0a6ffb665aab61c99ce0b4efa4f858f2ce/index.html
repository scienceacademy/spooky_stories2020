        <h1>SPOOKY STORY BY ANGIE CHOI</h1>
        <h2>The Scarecrow's Molds</h2>
        <img src="gigiandbaba.jpg" width=210>
        <p>Up in a tiny village, there was a grandma and a grandpa, named Baba and Gigi, living in a farm. The farm was full of their resources - such as cows for milk and plants for food. The wheat farm was one of their prized possession, since it gave them rice. On a sunny day where all the birds were flying up in the air, all of a sudden all the birds started attacking and eating the wheat off. Gigi was starting to freak out and ran inside to tell Baba what happened.</p>
        <p>“Omg Baba, you really have to see what’s going on out there. Do you know what’s happening?” questioned Gigi.</p>
        <p>“No? What is happening anyways!” Baba exclaimed at ran out the door to check upon the farm, “Omg what happened here! I swear to god, these birds are driving me crazy lately! Gigi we have to go pick up a scarecrow at the market.” </p>
        <p>“I don’t know why we didn’t do that early,” sighed Gigi, “I guess we can’t have rice for the next week.” </p>
        <p>Gigi and Baba went to the market called “SuperMartK” to pick up the scarecrow and along some pumpkins, since it was almost Halloween. That night when they were on their way coming back from SuperMartK, a huge chilly wind blew across the whole town. Gigi and Baba just ignored it, since sometimes wind blows a lot in the village. But this wind was different than the others.
	That night when they set up the scarecrow by their field, another cool wind blew across the whole city. Still the grandma and the grandpa didn’t think anything was odd. So Gigi and Baba just went to sleep. The next morning there was a news about the mysterious death around the town.</p>
	    <p>“Gigi, wake up!” shouted Baba.</p>
	    <p>“Ugh what, I’m still sleeping here,” said Gigi while being annoyed. </p>
        <p>“Apparently, people started to die out of no where, since yesterday night,” Baba said while being worried, “Let’s try not to go out anymore before something bad happens to us.”</p>
        <p>“Ok, I guess we have to be careful,” spoke Gigi.</p>
        <p>That day Grandma Gigi went up to the field to check up on the animals and the wheat farm that the birds destroyed yesterday. All of a sudden the scarecrow moved up and down and the straw hands started to move up close to do the grandma. The grandma was terrified, so she screamed loudly hoping that Baba heard her.</p>
        <p>“HELP! HELP! HELP!” shouted Gigi while the scarecrow was about to murder her.</p>
        <p>The scarecrow gobbled Gigi so fast, like a hungry person that didn’t eat for days. Gigi was in the scarecrow’s tummy and then all of a sudden Baba came out to check up upon Gigi, since she didn't come in for a while. </p>
        <p>“Gigi! Gigi! It’s almost lunchtime, shouldn’t you be making some lunch for us. I’m starving so much. What should we eat? Gigi? Where are you? Can you hear me?” questioned Baba. </p>
        <p>The scarecrow became terrified that he might have gotten caught, so it molded himself into the grandma. The mold was exactly how Gigi looked like in real life with the curly silky hair, shiny pearl necklace, straw hat, and a knitted sweater. After a while, Baba came forward to Gigi and questioned her.</p>
        <p>“Gigi, what are you doing here. Come in already. I’m getting so hungry,” whispered Baba pointing to go in.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was a loud whish sound that scared Baba away. When Baba went in the farm to just make his own lunch, Gigi was inside the scarecrow that got molded. Quietly the scarecrow went back to its position, then all of a sudden rain drops started to drop. Baba comes out to check upon Gigi again, since it started to rain. But the scarecrow’s mold’s weakness is the water. </p>
        <p>“Gigi! It’s raining whats taking forever?” shouted Baba, “Omg! Gigi is that you!?” </p>
        <p>Baba started to panic and started telling the whole village that the scarecrows are dangerous. No one believed it and thought it was Baba being delusional. Baba didn’t know what to say at this point, since no one trusted him. 
Few days later, a person died from a scarecrow again. Then people started to believe Baba how the scarecrows were killing their loved ones. Gratefully, people were warned by Baba a little earlier. Baba and the village people decided to throw away the scarecrows somewhere far away.</p>
        <p>“Literally I would let birds eat my wheat rather than scarecrows killing my family members!” a man shouted.</p>
        <p>“What is up with SuperMartK!?” exclaimed an old lady, “Do we have to sue them or something. This is dangerous. Are they joking or what!”</p>
        <p>All the villagers teamed up to vanish SuperMartK out of this town. Since, they didn’t have any more super markets around, Baba had a huge idea. He never had a better idea than this. He thought of building his own super market to buy his wife back from the evil master of the scarecrows. They still don’t know why they made a scarecrow like this, but anyways they have to get Gigi and the other missing people back. So he made a super market called “GB Mart.” People were very happy with this wonderful idea. Baba earned so much money like he was getting money from the sky every second. It was too good to be true. Since now he got a lot of money, was he able to save the loved ones from the evil mysterious person? </p>
