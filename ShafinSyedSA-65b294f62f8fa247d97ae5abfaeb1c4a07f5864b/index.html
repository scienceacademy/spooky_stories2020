      <h1 class="title"><b>The Krew Killer</b></h1>
      <h2 class="section">Is the killer closer than you think maybe even one of your friends?</h2>
      <p>Tera went outside to go get the morning newspaper for her father when she saw the headline, 
      “Serial Killer on the Loose.” She rushed indoors and quickly shut the door; whipped out her 
      phone and texted the group chat the horrifying news.</p>
      <p>Maiya, Nico, and Zahi were out playing basketball when they received the message. Lance was 
      working on his car in the small place that he had gotten with his sister at the beginning of 
      the year when he received the shocking news. Kiandra was at her ballet class this morning so 
      she wasn’t able to check her phone. After her class was over her heart froze at the sight of 
      the news article that Tera had sent the group, “Serial Killer on the Loose.”</p>
      <h2 class="section">Two Days Later…</h2>
      <p>On the overhead speakers throughout the school, the voice of the principal could be heard 
      telling everyone to be careful. The week went by with a couple of bodies being found around town. 
      Tera started to plan the winter break vacation with her friends where they would stay in a cabin 
      for a week.</p>
      <h2 class="section">One Week Later…</h2>
      <p>Lance filled his duffel bag with clothes to take. He had worked a semi-shady job at night to 
      earn enough money to buy coats for the trip. Zahi packed once he got home from school for the trip 
      the next day. He had been to cabins like these before and since he didn’t trust the heaters he packed 
      extra clothes. Maiya and Nico walked to Maiya’s home to pack then they left for Nico’s place. After 
      they were packed they left to get ice cream at a nearby place with the rest of the group as it was 
      Maiya’s 17th birthday.</p>
      <p>The next day the group met at Tera’s house. They waited for her father to come home to drive 
      them to the cabin in the mini-bus. The friends waited around talking about school, grades, and 
      the latest relationships until Maiya brought up the topic of the serial killer. Lance seemed to 
      get white and clenched the armrests. Tera saw that Lance got flustered and kept a mental note of 
      it. Zahi cracked a joke about the serial killer. The group laughed and forgot about the topic when 
      they heard the door open. Tera’s father had arrived. Time to get on the road.</p>
      <p>The ride to the cabin was about a 2-hour drive. Zahri slept most of the way, Maiya and Nico played 
      a game together, Lance listened to music the whole ride, and Kiandra watched Youtube then slept. Tera 
      thought about what had happened in her house when Lance got white when they were talking about the 
      serial killer. She began wondering if going on this trip was a good idea or not because what if the 
      serial killer wanted to add to his body count.</p>
      <p>They soon arrived at the cabin where Tera’s father dropped them off. </p>
      <p>The group got settled into their own rooms in the mansion of a cabin. Tera showed her friends around 
      the cabin and let them choose their own rooms on the first or second floor. Tera, Lance, Zahi, and Kiandra 
      chose to stay on the second floor, while Nico and Maiya chose to stay on the first floor.</p>
      <p>A few days passed by without any issues until a storm hits the area of the cabin. It was 2 days until they 
      were supposed to leave.  They were snowed in and their cell phones weren’t working. They couldn’t call anyone 
      or check the news. Once the snowstorm hit the heat in the cabin stopped. Tera went outside to check only to see 
      that there was a knife that was stuck in the heater that looked like it was new there because the heater had been 
      working earlier in the week. The group all brought their blankets together in the living room where the fireplace 
      was, but there weren’t any logs for the fire. The group agreed on splitting up to go look for logs or anyone that 
      had cell reception for them to call for Tera’s father. They agreed to meet after 2 hours of looking or if anyone 
      got lost to come back to the cabin and yell for the others.</p>
      <p>Lance led Kiandra and Zahi toward the dark woods until the storm’s winds blinded them. After the winds died down 
      a bit Lance looked around looking for his friends only to find them gone.</p>
      <p>Tera told Nico and Maiya to lead them while she kept up the rear when winds made them lose their footing and they 
      fell down in the snow. Nico and Maiya looked up just to see that Tera was gone. Logically they started yelling for 
      her and when they couldn’t find her they started going back to the cabin. On the way toward the cabin, they saw Lance 
      walking away from it, and Tera walking towards it from the other side.</p>
      <p>The friends regrouped and then split up again to go looking for the missing friends worried about their safety.</p>
      <p>Lance and Maiya went looking while Tera and Nico looked around the cabin area in hopes that the friends would come back. 
      Tera and Nico eventually went inside and started to look around the cabin rooms. They checked all the rooms then went into 
      Lance’s room. Tera checked the closet only to be horrified by her findings.Kiandra and Zahi were now gone forever. Tera looked around more and found a list with their names on it with the names of their 
      “missing friends” scratched out and the murder weapon, a bloodied knife in a bag under the bed.</p>
      <h2 class="section">A Few Hours Later…</h2>
      <p>Tera’s father had arrived and the cell phones started to work again. Tera immediately called for the police with the 
      evidence at hand.</p>
      <p>The police arrived to haul Lance off with all the evidence against him.</p>
      <p>“HAhaha,” thought Tera, “these idiots fell for it, they’ll never catch me!”</p>
