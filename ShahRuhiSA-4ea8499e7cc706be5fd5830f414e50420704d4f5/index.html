<p>It was the night of Halloween, and a festive party was going on. Ghostly lights and carved jack-o-lanterns lit up the area, along with spooky glowing skeletons. Kids were dressed in scary costumes, running to every door and holding bags of candy. The party was being hosted at the Woods’ house. Their daughter Lilith had invited some of her friends over to the party since she thought she was a bit too old to go trick or treating. Her friends were Maggie, Inesha, Caleb, Connor, and Nate. Inside, the house was decorated from top to bottom with paper chains and streamers. “Nice party!” Nate exclaimed to Lilith. “Thanks! I helped put up all the streamers and made the cookies” Lilith said  back. “Cookies?! Where?” Inesha and Maggie said at the same time, looking up from petting Lilith’s dog. Lilith laughed and guided all five of them to the kitchen. “These cookies are tasty” Connor said. “Mmph hm!” Maggie said in agreement, her voice muffled by the cookies. “Why don’t we go to my treehouse? It’s getting a bit crowded in here” Lilith suggested. The six teenagers nodded in unison and went off into the forest. “Do any of you see the treehouse?” asked Inesha. “No not yet, it’s already dark. We should’ve brought a lantern.” Lilith said, slightly frustrated that they couldn’t see anything. “I’ll go back to the house to get one. You guys keep going.” said Caleb although before any of them could agree, he was already jogging back. “Why don’t we split up? That way we can search faster.” Nate proposed. “Sounds good. Connor you can go with Nate in that direction and Inesha, Maggie and I will go together in this direction” Lilith said pointing in two directions. They walked off in their groups, searching for the treehouse.</p>
<p>Inesha walked a bit behind her group, distracted by the full moon. “Are you coming?” yelled Maggie from farther away. “Coming!” she yelled back. “I’ll just quickly take a picture of the moon” she said to herself. And at that moment, Inesha was knocked out cold. “Gosh what is taking her so long” exclaimed Lilith, looking backwards. “She isn’t here anymore…” Maggie said looking around, slightly nervous. “I bet she went to go find the boys, lets keep going I’m sure she’s fine” Lilith said exasperated. They continued walking in their direction before hearing a rustle behind them. The girls spun around quickly, “W-who’s there?” Lilith asked, fear washing over her. Suddenly a light popped out, revealing the face of Caleb. “Oh good! We found you guys” he said, emerging from the bush, closely followed by Nate. “Have you guys seen Connor? He went missing right before Caleb showed up with the lantern. We thought he went to your group.” The girls looked to the others, obviously confused. “He isn’t with us and Inesha went missing too. We thought she went to your group.” The four kids looked at each other as a chilly breeze rustled the leaves on the trees. “Then…..where are they?” Caleb asked quietly. They stayed quiet, unsure of what to do. “Maybe they went back to the house? Nate thought aloud. “We should also head back, it’s dark and we can’t find the treehouse anyways” Lilith said firmly. “Hold on I think I dropped my phone” Maggie said, getting on her knees and searching the ground. “I’ll stay with her and help, you both can start going back” Caleb said quickly. Lilith and Nate shrugged but started heading back. “Don’t take too long!” Nate hollered. </p>
<p>“Help! It’s got Maggie! Help!” Caleb started screaming, running towards Lilith and Nate. “W-what?!” yelped Lilith, turning around to see a running Caleb. “I was helping Maggie find her phone and then s-she was gone!” said a very shaken up Caleb. Lilith sat down on a nearby log, the realization of what was happening finally hitting her. Nate comforted Caleb quickly and stood up “Now we really have to get back to the hou-”. And just like that Nate was out too. Lilith looked up, wondering why Nate stopped talking so abruptly. And the last thing she saw was Caleb’s evil grin before all the lights went out.</p>
