        <p class="title"><b>One day, before Halloween started, 2 boys, one named Bill and another named Jack, decided to go into a forest to play hide and seek. Jack and Bill were best friends. They both went to the same school and were neighbors. Jack usually likes to prank Bill for fun. The forest was dry, quiet, and abandoned, with the sky darker than the night. One point, Bill was a hider and Jack was the seeker. While Jack was trying to find Bill, he was thinking of another way to praink Bill. All of sudden, Jack heard a yell. Followed by the yell was a rustle of leaves. He was confused since he thought Bill was trying to reveal his location. He shouted,</b></p>
        <p class="title"><b>“Bill! Why are you trying to reveal your location!”</b></p>
        <p class="title"><b>When Jack came to the area, noticed something was wrong. He noticed that there was a empty dirt path to what seemed like a mansion. The mansion looked like it was going to fall apart at any minute. Even though it looked somewhat suspicious, Jack decided to go inside and see what was in it for himself. This was the biggest mistake that Jack made in his whole life. The mansion at first looked luxurious. Jack decided to go further into the mansion. Eventually, he got lost. When Jack decided to go leave the mansion and try to find Bill, the mansion looked a bit different. It felt a bit more darker than usual. He noticed that there was a puzzle he had to solve. It was a puzzle that said, </b></p>
        <p class="title"><b>“What grows like watermelons but is orange?.”</b></p>
        <p class="title"><b>Jack immediately knew it was a pumpkin and got it right. There was another puzzle that was next to the first puzzle. It said, </b></p>
        <p class="title"><b>“What is clear that spooks you?”</b></p>
        <p class="title"><b>While he was thinking on how to solve it, he thought he saw a shadowy figure peer into the room. It looked like some person with ragged robes. Because of this, his mind went from searching for the solution to wanting to run away as fast and far as possible. After a few minutes, however, he found out the solution, which was a ghost. Jack started wondering whether the mysterious figure was related with the puzzle. After solving it, Jack immediately goes out onto a dark and empty hallway. The hallway was long to the point Jack started getting tired. He couldn’t even tell if he reached the end or not. All of a sudden, he heard sounds. </b></p>
        <p class="title"><i>POW</i></p>
        <p class="title"><b>The mansion suddenly started caving in. This turned on Jack’s fight or flight response. As a result, he started running until he reached the end of the seemingly endless hallway. Jack then notices that the end of the hallway had led him to an exit. He went through the exit immediately. As soon as Jack got through the exit, he ran off back into his house. He then notices Bill was next to his house. Bill told him that the entire “mansion” was actually an old cabin in which he decided to turn into a prank. Jack asks him about that shadowy figure and Bill tells Jack that it was him the whole time. </b></p>
