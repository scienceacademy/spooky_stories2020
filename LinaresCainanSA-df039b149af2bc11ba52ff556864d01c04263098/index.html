        <h1>
            How was I Involved?
        </h1>
        <p>
            “WHY! What evidence proves this fear. I am just a girl!"
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember learning about my town’s founders and how they arrived in the Americas and why.
            I do not remember much about it. What I wanted to know was more about the supernatural.
            I had heard stories of people going missing or people seeing strange humanoid figures in the woods.
            What I was really interested in was the possession of a group of girls by the devil.
            What could they have done to receive that experience? That’s when I heard a loud smack and pain
            rushed through my hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What are you doing Ms.Fletcher? Pay attention! Now, name who founded this city,” Mr.Fuller, the teacher, exclaimed.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Roger Canent, sir. He is the man who founded Salem.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “WRONG! It was Roger Conant!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sir, I am incredibly sorry, but …”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I do not want to hear it, Fletcher!”
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting out of class, I ran to my house. My father greeted me with greetings and lunch.
            I asked him about yesterday’s events, the possessed girls. My father looked worried and told me to quiet down.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why must I, father?” I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I heard people were getting accused of using a demonic force, a force used for evil.
            The town is investigating what caused the possession. The girls believe it may have been a group of women,” he replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            “But why can’t I ask or know more about it?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I do not want them suspecting you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “They will not, father, that is a foolish choice to make.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, I want to be safe.”
        </p>
        <p>
            A couple of days went by. I was in class again when I had a huge urge to ask about the possession.
            I spoke out of turn and yelled, “What is happening with the case of the girls’ possessions?
            I mean what demonic force was used? Also, are you sure it was a group of women?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The teacher responded, “Excuse me? We are learning how to read the bible! Why do you want this information?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I mean, what… what… was used to ‘possess’ the girls. Why m-”. I was interrupted by a hard slap on the hands and yelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            “WHAT PART OF ‘LEARNING HOW TO READ THE BIBLE’ DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND! No more questions!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “but. . .”
        </p>
        <p>
            “BE QUIET MS.FLETCHER”
        </p>
        <p>
            My hands met the long staff and responded with a loud “SNAP”.
            My hands bled. I was sent to the corner of the room to stare at a wall for the remainder of the class.
            I later ran home to my father crying.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What happened?!” My father exclaimed.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I was hit by the staff and sent to the corner!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “What for?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I asked about the. . . possession - I AM SORRY!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “WHY! I told you not to.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I know but. . .”
        </p>
        <p>
            “‘I know’! NO YOU DON’T KNOW! ‘I know’”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Father, I am-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “GO TO YOUR BED!”
        </p>
        <p>
            A sudden cloud of rain passed over the town that night.
            I was very ashamed. I cried all night and skipped dinner. In the middle of the night, my father sat on my bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What?” I asked in sorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I just want to tell you how much I love you. I did not mean to yell, it was instinct,” He told me.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What instinct made you yell?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Panic.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Panic?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, I thought of what could happen to you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “What could happen to me."
        </p>
        <p>
            “Do not get frightened. You may be sent to court.
            A few people outside the group of women have been accused of, what people are calling it, ‘witchcraft’ (the demonic force).
            I have heard about witchcraft but never thought it was real.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “So what if people are being accused.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “One has been executed”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “By asking, you may get accused.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “But it was only a question.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I don’t understand what the logic behind that is.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Me neither, but I just needed to tell you. I love you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I love you too, father”
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day, I went to school and apologized to the teacher. He sent me to my desk and the lesson started.
            In the middle of reading, a group of men walked into.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We request Mary Fletcher in the name of the court,” the men stated.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why me?” I asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We have questions.”
        </p>
        <p>
            They took me to the courtroom. I was told they will begin in an hour. “What will begin?” I questioned.
            “Was what father told me coming true?” I panicked and ran to leave. I ran around a corner and was met by the judge’s chest.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Excuse m. . . Ms.Fletcher?!”
        </p>
        <p>
            I panicked, I pushed him and tried to run past him. He just turned around and grabbed me firmly by the wrist.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why are you running? Do you have something to hide?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No!.... sir.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Then we will not have a problem.”
        </p>
        <p>
            We walked into the courtroom and passed the group of men who took me from school.
            I was sent to the stand in front of the court member while they stood on a stand.
            They looked around and gave each other a nod.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Mary Francis Fletcher. You have been accused of being associated with witchcraft.
            Yesterday was an eye-opener for us.” The head judge stated.
        </p>
        <p>
            “What do you mean?” I responded.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We have reason to believe you are interested in the practice of witchcraft.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I am not, sir. Why do you believe so.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “We know you wonder about things that cannot be explained. We have been told that in history class,
            you question ‘what truly happened’. Such as the roanoke colony, you asked if a group of unearthly creatures took the
            settlers. Did you not?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I did, but I really w-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Then it is yes. We also have reason to believe that you want to practice witchcraft.
            You asked, to quote, ‘What is happening with the case of the girls’ possessions?
            I mean what demonic force was used? Also, are you sure it was a group of women?’ Correct?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, I was asking if there was another-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Why did you ask? Were you gathering information for your own practice?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No, sir.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Then what for?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I was questioning what occurred. I wanted to know if it really was a demonic force that caused it.
            What if it was some sort of… a. . . thing that we do not know of.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “We do not know of witchcraft.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “But you believe it is a thing, I mean what if the ‘possession’ was caused by something you do not
            believe or even know about.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And why are you so interested in witchcraft?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “It is not witchcraft I am interested in, it is the reason for events.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well we know it was witchcraft. Why are you trying to deflect the idea of witchcraft?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I am not deflecting the idea of anything, in particular, I just want to know what truly happened.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, it was witchcraft.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “But can you but sure a-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “WE ARE POSITIVE! Why are you asking the same questions? Are you trying to hide something or stop progressing of this trial?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Of course not, sir.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “OK then. How do we know you are telling the truth Ms.Fltcher?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I… I… have been telling the truth, sir.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And how do we know that for sure, what evidence supports this claim?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “There is none, but what proof supports your claim!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “We are not claiming anything, we are just putting you in a trial Ms.Fletcher. What are you saying claim?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Nothing, I just thought you assumed I was-”
        </p>
        <p>
            “A witch?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, no, I mean maybe.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And why would you assume that?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Because of many people you are suspecting to practice witchcraft.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Do you believe we will prove you guilty?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No, I have nothing to be guilty of.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I believe you do. When you were born, your mother died after being born, is that not correct?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, only me and my dad live together, but that does not mean anything.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, we believe you were born with the gift of witchcraft built into you.
            After your mother’s death, we have seen paranormal activities happening around you,
            such as huge gusts of wind blowing things over when you get mad, and it rains when you get sad and cry, which is rarely.
            We believe this is not by coincidence.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “But I did not do those things.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Maybe not on purpose, but you are linked to them.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No, sir, I am not.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The judge stopped talking and grouped up with the men on the stand.
            They whispered for a few minutes and came back to the stands.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Mary Francis Fletcher, I am sorry to say,” At that moment, my heart stopped,
            “that you have been found guilty and sentenced for immediate execution to protect our town.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “WHY! What evidence proves this fear. I am just a girl!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “We have explained our reasons, we will not repeat ourselves.”
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried to run away, but two large men pushed me back and grabbed me.
            They dragged me to the center of the town where they called everyone in town to show up.
            I saw my dad in the crowd. I yelled at him. He saw me and ran to get me, but the law-enforcers stopped him.
            I saw them attack the men but was struck down by a man with a club to the head. Without him, nobody was going to save me.
            The man grabbed my head and picked me up. I saw a mechanism I had never seen before.
            He put my head in a rope and tightened it around my neck. I fought and fought but could not get free.
            The rope was so tight, I could barely breathe. I was set onto a stand where my feet barely touched.
            I saw the man who put me into the rope give a speech in front of everyone.
            I didn’t hear what he was saying, I was focused on escaping. I almost opened the rope.
            Another man came up and tightened it again and held me. The man finished his speech and pulled the stand under me.
            I fell in slow motion and heard a crack in my neck, pain rushed through me.
            I was suspended off the ground for a few seconds before all the air was taken out of my throat.
            After that, I felt a horrible feeling and started to pass out. To me, I experience the last second like a full minute.
            Then, I blacked out.
