        <h1 class="title">Haunted Myths</h1>
        <p>It was the middle of October, the leaves were falling and there was a group of boys camping, surrounded by crunchy dried leaves and the crisp autumn air, telling each other myths and folklore that they had learned from their grandparents. “Ok, Ok, guys that's cool and all, but can I please share my story?”, a boy by the name of John had asked impatiently. At once, the boys chorused a string of yes’s and sure’s. John started retelling the story that his grandfather told him only years prior.
“Once upon a time there was a fair maiden. She lived in a tiny town during the 18th century. She was well known in her village for her kindness, beauty, and intelligence. Her dad was the town’s mayor and she was showered with love and affection since the day she was born. To anyone outside their family, they seemed like a perfect family; a handsome and influential father, a beautiful and kind mother, and lastly, a beautiful young girl. What they didn't know was that behind the facade of a perfect family laid a deep secret, the secret that the mayor had an illegitimate daughter with another woman. Since the illegitimate daughter of the mayor was a constant reminder of his bad decisions, the mayor had treated that daughter disdain and scorn; and that daughter was always the subject of his verbal and physical abuse. 
The fair maiden was incredibly kind, every time she saw her half-sister being treated in a horrible way, she would step in to defend her. Whenever she stepped in, her father would praise her for her kindness while the illegitimate daughter glared at her in anger and hatred. On her eighteenth birthday, her parents were calling for her with no avail. Curious about her mysterious disappearance, her parents went to check her room but were faced with a tragic note written in crimson red blood.</p> 
<p>The note read, Dear Parents of Aurora (the fair maiden),
Your daughter will not appear in time for her eighteenth birthday, nor will she ever appear again.
Good luck finding her body,
Blood Countess”</p>
<p>“Wait- I know who it is!” interrupted the boy's best friend. Annoyed, John harshly told his best friend to be quiet and not spoil the story. Reluctantly John’s friend agreed. 
	“As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, the note was written in blood and as a normal person would react, her parents freaked out. Her father ordered all the men in their tiny town to look all over for his golden child. When all hope seemed lost, one of the mayor’s best friends called out, ‘Wait isn’t this your daughter?!’ and pointed to the ground where the mutilated body of a once beautiful maiden laid. Horrified at the sight of her body, the mayor organised a quick funeral in the memory of his younger daughter. Overcome with grief and what was once sadness, the mayor went on a quest to find the killer of his young daughter. Unfortunately for him, he could not make it very far, for the one responsible for her death had fled the country in fear of execution-”
“Wait so you're telling me, this is how it ends?”, interjected Bob. “No! For the sake of god, will you just please let me finish my story?”, exclaimed John. “After the mayor and his wife died, the town people had stated that they heard a wailing noise of an unknown girl right hours prior to where they found the body of the dead girl. This myth states that after the killer had died, they resurrected as a spirit that haunts and kills happy children in hatred for the children that did not go through what she had gone through as a child.”
	“And guys, since then the town was abandoned and was said to be haunted by the angry spirit. And the worst part is, the town is approximately around the area we are right now.” At this, all the boys jumped up in fear and scurried to their tents. Knowing that all their friends were in their tents out of fear, John and his best friend played a recording of the supposed wailing noise the spirit made before killing her victims. His friends at this point were bawling their eyes out, “Please don’t kill me! Please don’t kill me!”, because of their friends' reactions, John and his best friend could not hide the laughter that they were holding in for so long. Hearing laughter, their friends came out to the sight of John and his best friend with a speaker that made wailing noises. Because they were so scared, they made John and his best friend sleep outside as a consequence for scaring the living lights out of them.</p>
