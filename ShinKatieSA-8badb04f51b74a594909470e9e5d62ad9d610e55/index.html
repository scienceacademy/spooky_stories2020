        <h4>KILL ________</h4>
        <p>    </p>
        <p> “Bob, what kind of behavior is that on a camping trip!” Stacy exclaimed as Bob had stolen all the food from her backpack. We all laughed as it was indeed a “Bob behavior” to do, because he liked messing around with his friends. 
</p>
        <p>I had gone on a camping trip with 4 of my friends, because the sky was assumed to be clear and steady for a couple of days. People could have assumed we lived on a tropical island. However, that is not the case as we live in Minnisota, a cold place, and chilly on most days. As a surprise, Mary gave us the invitation to a group camping trip. Two days later, we decided to go hiking and a five day journey forward and back.
</p>
        <p>“You know, the sun is about to set down. What about resting for the night?” Gregory put out. We all agreed, as it was getting a colder by the minute. As we get our essential needs, I inspect the place that we’re going to rest on. The ground was stiff, a little bit rocky, and the trees loomed over all of us, as if it was going to poke our faces. While scary-looking, it was quite… captivating. The wind suddenly stopped blow-drying in our faces, which everyone in the group said was negligible, but a benefit to our being. I decided to sleep anyway, even with the uncomfortable surrounding gaping at me.
</p>
        <p>	“AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!”
</p>
        <p>“What is it, what is it?” I calmly wake up and look at Gregory, who has the image of a pale ghost.
</p>
        <p>He points at a person right in front of him, and as I slowly turn my face, I see a body covered in a red, dark liquid. Mary had died.
</p>        
        <p>All of us whipped our heads and stared at each other. Bob nodded at me, and I nodded back at him. Bob stood up from his relaxed position, and went to the deceased body. He looked and inspected, and found a piece of paper. Covered in smudges of blood, it said: “Kill Mary.”
</p>
        <p>“It’s none of us, right? It can’t be, because we’re all friends and we love each other. We especially loved cheerful Mary.” Bob spoke quietly as he spread the paper around everyone. 
</p>
        <p>“I think so too. I’m sure that Mary just slipped or stumbled into sharp sticks. She is known for her clumbsiness. We should go back home and tell Mary’s family the unfortunate news of their daughter.” I had replied. I thought that just for a second, Bob wasn’t actually feeling sorrow, but that could just be the death affecting me, affecting all of us. Taking another sleep, it was clear that everyone was going to sleep with their eyes open, afraid that they could be the victim of Hades. The wind was howling again, shaking the trees and targeting the nearest humans, which was us. The moon was hidden beneath the cloud, a sure sign that nothing good was going to happen.
</p>
        <p>The next morning, I wake up first. It was gloomy; as if a depressed person was waving at me from the sky. I turned to the nearest person next to me, expecting Bob, but instead a piece of wrapper replaced him. The plan was working. “Guys, wake up. Bob’s missing!” I hurriedly shake the bodies of my friends, who had eyebags under their bloodshot beedy needles. Gregory comes to Bob’s sleeping spot, or what is now just a piece of paper, and widens his eyes. </p>
        <p>Stacy suddenly calls the three of us over to the cliff, where we see nothing but ocean. “Guys, look below us.” Stacy had told us. We can see a limp body below, a little bit blurry, but it was clear the murder took place. Or so the others thought. “Guys, it's obvious that Bob accidently walked over the cliff. I mean, he sleepwalks so much, but that cost him his life,” Stacy had said, but she sounded kind of happy. We all nodded our heads, as Bob does indeed sleepwalk like no other. As if the incident had been forgotten, we all started to pack out things, back to the journey to go home.
</p>
        <p>The third night falls quickly, as if fate wanted to entrap their victims faster. Stacy nervously chuckled, as nobody was talking. The silence that had stilled caused such suspense, that I decided to go to sleep. I dreamed of a life that when I wake up, nothing except bodies and money will be surrounding me, making me filthy rich. A simple book lies beneath me, a diary infact, with the date October 31, 1942. 
</p>
        <p>I wake up, and I feel so refreshed, since I slept like a baby. I see Gregory right next to me, but something is wrong with Stacy. Her face was swollen, and her eyes were dilated. She wasn’t moving at all. She had an empty poison vial next to her, with exactly 2 words. Kill Stacy. Gregory next to me woke up and smiled at me. “Good morning. The deed is done.”
</p>
        <p>I slowly stared at him and grinned widely too. Then I started MY case of murder. 
</p>
        <p2>October 31, 1942</p2>
        <p></p>
        <p2>I went on a camping trip with 4 of my friends 30 years ago. I told each of them to abet me in a series of murder. I told each of them to kill one person of the group, and assured them the rest would be taken care of. Of course, as murder isn’t cheap, I told them I would give them money, thousands of dollars, just for a simple task. Oh, and they thought it was easy! Now, Bob killed poor Mary, who didn’t even do anything. Stacy killed Bob, who never had it coming, and Gregory killed clueless Stacy. Gregory was then killed by who? By me, of course. Also, if you’re reading this, don’t be scared. I’ll make your death a magnificent one!
</p2>
        <p2>Yours truly,</p2>
