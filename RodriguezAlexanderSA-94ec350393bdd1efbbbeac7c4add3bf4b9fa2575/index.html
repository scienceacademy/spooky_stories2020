<h1>Beyond A Game</h1>
<h2>By, Alexander James Rodriguez</h2>
<p> It all started when I received a virtual reality headset from my uncle. The idea was that I would download some games, which <br>
explored different countries from the comfort of my bedroom. For the longest time, I used the headset to go to places of great wonder, <br>
like Sydney Opera House and the Taj Mahal. It was amazing and I didn't even have to board a plane, but after a while it became a bit <br>
boring, so against my moms knowledge I found a game called Halloween Hunters and downloaded it. I loved playing the game, full of <br>
twists and turns. I played on the VR day and night, every opportunity I had, directly from school and well into the night. I was <br>
obsessed!. My mom would joke sometimes saying things like, “You're going to break the headset from playing so much,” or “One day your <br>
going to be sucked into it!” Well, eventually that day came, and what a frightful day it was. <br>

<br>So, on this particular day I had successfully reached a climax in the game, I had finally reached level thirty, and it was the coolest <br>
and the spookiest. It was so unique to the other levels so far, it was all set in the woods. At first, they looked like any other woods, <br>
you know, the standard trees and shrubs, but then suddenly the time inside the game seemed to have changed and I found myself alone in <br>
the dark. I felt a woosh of coldness and a feeling of dread rushed over me. I was actually feeling quite chilly, and for real. I remember <br>
thinking to myself perhaps the game had glitched or the headset shut down, and that it was a good moment to grab a hoodie and a glass of <br>
water from the kitchen. As I pulled off the VR headset I was in complete and utter shock. Naturally, I was expecting to be stood in the <br>
comfort of the warm family lounge, but to my utmost horror I was with no headset and still in the hallowed woods of the game. I was in <br>
the woods of Halloween Hunters, in a place so dark and eerie. The twisting branches from the aging trees were no longer in 3D and seemed <br>
to give me a most sinister glare. The rush of the creek nearby that flowed through the cold riverbank made sounds like an abnormal wail <br>
as if it were beckoning me to stay and lose myself in its icy depths. I inhaled deeply only to be welcomed with a sharp flow of air <br>
traveling through me like knives piercing my lungs, the chilling breeze sent shivers down my spine. I began to panic, slowly spiralling <br>
into blind hysteria. I was abandoned in the dead of night, with not a star or even the moon in sight. The dark ceiling above was made up <br>
of clouds so gray that they felt closer every living breath I took, yet as I embraced them they seemed to give off a ghostly glow. In the <br>
strangest of ways, it seemed as if they were happy to see me. The ground began to swirl with wild light that was littered with bright orange <br>
and burnt red leaves that made the illusion of dancing flames, flickering for life. The moment of darkness passed and I found myself in a <br>
warmer and mildly brighter climate. <br>

<br>“He’s been standing there for almost an hour, Burlap!” A small voice said in the brush. <br>

<br>“That’s because he’s not the one! I told you he wasn’t the one, you wouldn’t believe me, Brutus!” The other replied indignantly.<br>

<br>I cautiously walked over to the brush all to discover three little pumpkins arguing with each other about who was “the one”. <br>

<br>“Oh. Erm. Hi. I’m Eddie. Where am I?” I managed to stutter out. The little pumpkins just giggled. <br>

<br>“Boy, I shall tell you. You are in a place you cannot reach by plane, and a place if you stay you will become insane!” <br>

<br>One of the pumpkins snarled, who looked like a Brutus as he was the biggest and had the ugliest carved face of them all. <br>

<br>“Oh. Yeah. Right. Actually, I want to go home, can you please show me the way?” I pleaded. <br>

<br>“You’ve had your head in the game for months, so it was only a matter of time before your whole body came in too!” Burlap giggled. At least
I thought it was Burlap as he had a decorative burlap bag on his head, worn like a hat. <br>

<br>“Follow the path to the three witches, and you just might survive!” the small one said helpfully.<br>

<br>“Three lives, that’s all you get, you will be dead by the time you get out I bet!” They all said synchronously, before bursting out in laughter. <br>

<br>Horrible little critters, I thought wryly. I tried to find the suggested path, I couldn’t see one, so I turned back around to ask the mischievous <br>
pumpkins where it was exactly, but they had since vanished. In their place was a tiny winding cobblestone road. It had weeds growing in all the <br>
open cracks and crevices, and there were three piles of bright orange and burnt red leaves. The path was hard to miss as it seemed to go on for <br>
miles, which made me wonder if the road was there before or if it had suddenly appeared. I decided to start my long trek on the mysterious path <br>
just like the over zealous pumpkins had suggested. After what seemed like forever of walking in a never changing landscape, the sky started to lose<br>
its glow and began to get darker once more. I continued to walk forward until my surroundings were so dark that I could no longer see the path ahead.<br>
Suddenly, a beam of light hit the ground, it was the moon, but not just any night time gibbous moon, a full and glorious one. A wolf howled off in <br>
the distance, I stopped dead in my tracks, “Could wolves smell fear, like all those scary stories I’ve heard before? Am I going to be devoured by <br>
some crazed wolf? The pumpkins said I had three lives, is that true?” Questions surged through my exhausted mind. I decided against testing out my <br>
theories and instead hastily walked over to a nearby rock formation to stay out of the moonlit night. A sigh of relief enveloped me, there was a <br>
small cave just big enough for me to crawl into. “I will hide here for a short while until the wolf catches another scent.” I thought to myself. <br>
As I entered enough to raise my body I heard a rustling coming from deeper inside the cave. “Is that … flapping?” I squinted to see but there weren't<br>
any shapes in the darkness. A short while later I felt a prickle on the back of my neck as if someone, or something was watching me. I turned around <br>
to see a pair of small beady yellow eyes staring at me. After what seemed like an eternity hundreds of admiring yellow eyes opened making the whole <br>
cave beam with light. “Bats!” I screamed internally. The colony of bats seemed to read my fear. They spread their wings like a dark cloud and flew <br>
out at lightning speed. I couldn’t hold it in any longer, I choked out a deafening scream, then everything went black.<br>

<br>Moments later I was back on the path. A glowing hologram projected out of my chest. It showed three red hearts, one of them flickered and disappeared <br>
like a used lightbulb, revealing the remaining two hearts. A description under the hologram read, “Died by bats, two lives remain.” I knew what this <br>
meant, “I can actually die in this game!” The idea of never escaping my once favorite pastime seemed to engulf me. The only glimmer of hope was that <br>
day break was imminent which marked the end of the terrifying night. I continued along the winding path wondering what the game had in store for me <br>
next.  I took these moments to assess what I was wearing. Instead of my normal shirt and jeans, I was dressed in green cargo bottoms and a pale peach <br>
t-shirt, but the most interesting adjustment to my appearance was a glowing multicolored gem that hung on a small chain around my neck. It looked like<br>
a tourmaline gemstone. When I touched it, it glowed brighter and hummed like a whirring bee. I quickly tucked it under my t-shirt for safekeeping, just <br>
in case it was a clue as to how I could return to reality. <br>

As I continued my strange journey, a little ways up a hill a dirty hut stood with a chimney that had a stream of smoke puffing from it. I could barely <br>
make out the three shadowy figures standing around what seemed like a steaming rusty cauldron. I ran towards them as fast as I could. The three figures <br>
wore witches hats and all three looked like withered hags. The first I noticed had no eyes in their place were dark pools of nothing, yet she seemed to <br>
see right through me. The second had no ears where ears should be, yet she seemed to hear my heart pounding heavily out of my chest. The third had her <br>
lips stitched together so that she could not speak, yet she seemed to communicate with ease. All three of them had gray, pasty skin and black wiry hair <br>
that shot out from the sides of their hats. <br>

“Hear no evil,” The one with no ears cackled.<br>

<br>“See no evil,” The one with no eyes continued.<br>

<br>“Speak no evil,” The third one seemed to whisper.<br>

<br>They all cackled around the cauldron, “I sense our senses, dear sisters!” The one with no eyes said.<br>

<br>“Yes, I see the boy from the prophecy!” The one with no ears shrieked as she stared at me with her milky white eyes.<br>

<br>“Hello,” I stuttered, “I’m Eddie, I was told you could get me home.” <br>

<br>“The tourmaline stone!” one said. “The stone!” another repeated. “Give us the stone that you wear around your neck!” they said in unison. <br>

<br>“No,” I said defiantly, “You must promise me that you will send me home to the real world!” <br>

<br>“Very well boy, we shall send you on your way, if you give us the stone that we so crave!” The one with no eyes shrieked. <br>

<br>We could have gone back and forth all day, so I handed over the necklace which hung around my neck to the one with no ears. <br>

<br>“Thank you boy,” she said. <br>

<br>“For giving us back what we had all lost, we will send you on your way.” said the one who used to have stitched lips. <br>

<br>The stitches had disappeared, just like how the one with no eyes gained a set of startling white ones, and the one with no ears now had a pair of her own. <br>

<br>“You weren’t meant to stay,” the first said. “Tis’ time to return to reality,” said the second.<br>

<br>“We hope you have a new mentality.” the third concluded. <br>

<br>All three of the witches let out a loud cackle until they slowly whirled into three familiar piles of bright orange and burnt red leaves. <br>
“Huh?!” I thought. <br>

<br>Suddenly a blinding white light flashed before my eyes and I felt someone grab onto  my shoulder. I screamed so loud in utter terror. <br>

<br>“That’s enough VR Eddie,” said a familiar voice. <br>

<br>Relief ran over me as my mom removed the headset from my face. I was in the living room, in my house. <br>

<br>“Yeah you’re right mom, I don't think I wanna touch that headset ever again!” I said. <br>

<br>“Really, why?” My mom chuckled. <br>

<br>“Let’s just say that Halloween Hunters got a bit too real!” I responded.<br>

<h2>THE END</h2>
