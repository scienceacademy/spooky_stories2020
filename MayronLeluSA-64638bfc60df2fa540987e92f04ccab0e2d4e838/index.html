             <h2>by Lelu Mayron</h2>
<p>Car by car, parents arrive at a small, dusty parking lot lined with 3 large, yellow busses, which contain the stench of mildew and fresh, sour body odor. A logo of a smiling sunshine and the words Camp Funtime cover the lower side of the bus. Three thin, wooden benches and picnic tables surround the arriving parents, which are covered by several bowls of fruit and vegetables and snacks ready to be devoured by whiny children and annoyed parents. Children clutch worned teddy bears, fearful to leave for an exciting two weeks without their parents, independent and on their own. 
Some  are talking, squealing, whispering to their friends regarding fun and memories from many years before, and how Johnny grew an inch, and how Jessica finally got her period, and how strong Counselor Matthews looks now and- 
A deafening whistle sounds commanding the campers to get in single-file lines to ignorantly go on their assigned bus and wave goodbye to their parents, (who are, by the way, crying as they won’t “see their babies for two weeks.”)
</p>
<p>Macy Holmes, driving her daughter, Amara, to the last place she will see her, who’s name ironically means “Immortal Being,” will soon realize that her daughter is indeed not as immortal as she thought and may need to begin the plans for a funeral. Getting out of her mother’s car, Amara, roughly 4 '11, extremely short for someone who is 13 years old, gives her mom a hug and a kiss as the loud whistle sounds. Waving goodbye, she climbs up the steep stairs of “Bus 5,” alone, ready to be away from her parents. She watches her mother, sitting alone at the picnic table (much like Amara is sitting alone on the bus) taking a large sip of water and checking her phone, as her face is painted white. She looks towards the bus in fear, and seems to be getting ready to cry. People never understand how mean my parents are to me, she thinks to herself.
The bus begins to depart with the poor children, who are slowly waving and saying “Goodbye mom! Goodbye dad! I’ll miss you.” The working parents are relieved that they get a break from their brats for two weeks, however, the needy parents who aren’t able to helicopter their children for a short amount of time, feel nothing but pain. What none of these disgraceful parents ever seemed to notice is how they would simply forget about their children, as if when they left the lot, all memory of their children had vanished.
	Stuck in her own thoughts, she doesn’t realize the bus slowly pulling out of the parking lot. Looking through the window, Amara eyeballs the parking lot, in search of her mother. Of course not. She’s never here. Noticeably upset, Amara tries to get comfortable and prepares to sleep on the long bus ride to camp.

<p>Pulling up to the camp grounds, the bus slowly comes to a stop. We see the genuine smile among everyone present at the camp, they are all ready for an amazing time. The doors open, as the bus driver is signaled to leave. How odd? The children are alone on the bus, with nothing to do. Chatter fills up the bus, consisting of, “Where are we,” and, “Why did we stop,” and, “Blah blah blah,” and, “I wonder when we'll get there.” 
A tall, wide man walks up the steps of the bus and stands at the head. He is very tall, 6’3 at least, most likely taller, and wears a content expression. The man seems to be in his late 50s, with a large gut and bad posture. He clears his throat, catching the attention of the campers, as he plays with his moustache, anticipating silence and cooperation. </p>
<p>“We have a bit of a problem.”</p>
The campers fall silent.
“Do you guys want good or bad news first?”
The campers begin to yell both “Good!” and “Bad!”
“I suppose the good news should go first, it’s more fun to get it over with, wouldn’t you think?”
The campers fall silent. 
“The good news is that we are finally at camp! You will each get off the bus in a professional manner and will greet a counselor to figure out what you will do next.”
<p>The campers begin to run out of their seats, barely able to contain themselves, all running off of the bus. Amara gets up from her seat, passing the Tall Man.</p>
<p>He mumbles, “The soft, faint cry of an ignorant, trusting child is always the perfect thing to brighten the day. Here comes the bad news, you ignorant sh*ts.” </p>
Amara looks up at him, then out the window, in which the counselors stand with their backs turned to the bus, holding something in their hands. She rushes to the window, pushing her face against the glass, trying to depict what they are holding. Knives, she thinks, the counselors are holding knives. Turning around she sees the Tall Man, who is pointing a gun to the center of her forehead
<p>“We are going to be playing a guessing game,” he laughs, almost cackling, scanning her with his emotionless eyes.
 “If you can guess the last camper that will be killed, you can stay alive.” </p>
<p> She takes a deep breath in, followed by a deep breath out. A faint cry sounds from the outside of the bus as blood spatters across the muddy ground, triggering mere pandamonium of children being assasinated. </p>

<p>“I am feeling impatient today.”</p>

<p>With a loud bang and signs of a merciless death, her life was over. Her blood was difficult to remove from the seats.</p>

<p>Car by car, parents arrive at the dusty parking lot. On the floor next to the park bench where she once sat lies the corpse of Macy Holmes. Her phone displays an article titled, “The Disappearance of a Camper, Anniversery of the Camp Funtime Murder on Friday, July 13, 2007.

“Hello campers,” says the Tall Man, “We are so excited for camp this summer!”
