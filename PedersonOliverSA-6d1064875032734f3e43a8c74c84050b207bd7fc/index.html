        <p>It started on a cold eerie night almost hellish at the time. We were all watching the news anxiously in the living room. We listened as the speaker mumbled in despair what they were trying to say. “I am mortified and discomforted to announce that the Covid-19 virus has mutated.” “Information on the unprecedented mutation is scarce and not much is known about it, please stay with us as this breaking news unveils..” “Oohhhh!” We gasped like never before. Deep inside I wondered why, just why, we didn't know what we were scared of or what was going on but we were afraid of it for some reason or another. Seconds after our outrage I looked at the news anchor's face and can still remember how pale and frightened it looked, like it had just seen someone stabbed in the chest with blood splattered everywhere. I had only seen a face like that once before. Soon after the news anchor made his announcement we started panicking

 Soon after the news anchor made his announcement we started panicking, deeply. My parents started making phone calls. In each one they sounded as if they were having heart attacks, eventually they made so many I lost track and dove into a world of anxiety and panicking. I felt like something was chewing up my insides, I never felt so un-ordered and distressed. Soon after we heard the news anchor again. We all sat down and watched glued to the tv. We were mesmerized as the news anchor said “Breaking news new information regarding the Covid-19 pandemic mutation, we have received new information pertaining the nature of the new mutation, symptoms include blood red eyes, paleness in the skin, mumbling in the voice, and the drive to kill and spread.” “If you see anyone with such symptoms please refrain from approaching them and keep a minimum of 15 feet.” “If someone 
is spotted with these symptoms please refer to calling the CDC and reporting the case.” 

Then they played the video. I can still remember the video to this day. It was not like anything I had ever seen before. It was just simply something out of a Spielberg book. We all had a great long pause watching it, it was a short video of people with symptoms. They looked like drug addicts but worse, they had dark velvet red eyes, black veins with blood as dark as ink and the pale grey skin like a dead person. They moved as if they weren't even functioning, walking as if  each limb only worked for a second. Then tires started screeching down the street outside and bang! We rushed out of the living room in fear as did all of our neighbours. There was a car, a blood red Honda Civic that was just stationary in the middle of the road. But something was I could just sense. I clenched onto my tongue and waited. The father of the freemans, our neighbours walked forward and came closer and closer to the car and then plop the door popped open came a middle aged asian man and started shouting, “Is he ok, is he ok.” Of course all of us were petrified with panic and fear at the time and we had zero clue on what he was talking about. But then we saw it was something we had never seen before. I put the clues together and figured the asian guy must have ran someone over. The asian guy continued “where is he, where is he, Is he ok.” Squirt! Blood went flying everywhere, the asian guy fell to the ground and these groaning sounds continued, “grruuuuuhh, gruuuuh” and then a nsaty chomp sound then made u want to throw up. It sounded like something was eating. Petrissia Freeman our neighbor walked over to check it out, she slowly walked sluggishly like a drunk, it must have been from nervousness I thought what else could it be. And then. “Ahhhhhhhhhh oh my god.” Petrissia froze, still petrified and started to shout, “Help, help.” The groaning stopped and took a long pause, then Cartmen the father of the freemans walked over to help his wife. He looked just as confused as the rest of us. Once he looked around the corner he stopped and put his hands on his mouth and just looked completely aghast. “Oh my god someone call 911” 

The groans started up again and Ccartmen fell on the floor. The groans got louder and louder. “Gruuuhhhhh, Gruhhhh!”  I heard a door slam open and an old tanty voice shout “ Stand back, stand back.” Then “Boom.” A gun fired off. From what I could see it was Mr mathews, he was a nutjob that lived across the street from us, I mean he was the type of person to believe the earth was flat, yeah that kind of nut job. “Someone call the feds the CDC.” My curious self stepped over and had to take a short glimpse of what happened, then I saw it, a sight I would never forget. Some guys head was blown open from Mr. Mathews blowing  his head in with a shotgun. His head was in so many pieces your wouldn't be able to count them. Red gooey stuff everywhere, it looked like blended brains, probably because that's what it was.

I froze like a computer that just shut off. I didn't have time to think nor process what just happened. I could only just stop. It was like time slammed the brakes and stopped in the moment. But time didn't stop, it went on as it always does. Noises such as voices continued. “Honey are you all right, what's wrong.” It took me a good minute to get out of it and then I heard a snap shot that went off as I turned like a sprinkler to my right. It was Mr. Mathews taking a picture of the mans head he just blasted off. His sick mind found something good, something joyful comedic even about it. I gagged at the thought of it and then paramedics arrived. Sirens buzzing and people panicking and crying. Relieved is the only way to describe  how I felt once I saw the buzzing light. I never felt so relieved and thankful in a weird way. After the sirens and lights stopped it felt as the day was over and the world continued as it always does.
