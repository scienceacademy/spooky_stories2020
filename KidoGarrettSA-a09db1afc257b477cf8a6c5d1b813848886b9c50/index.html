        <p>A raft floats down the river, it is headed for a small isolated island surrounded by water. When the raft slowly drifts on to the shore of the island and 48 people are forced off the ship by four guards, and the guards are followed by two scientists. The scientists then take note of how many people there are and the physical health of these people. The scientists and guards then leave the island of the raft. Many of the 48 people would never see their homes or their loved ones again.<br>
        One of the 48 people that were pushed off the raft was known as Dryden, before he had been sent to the island he was a construction worker. He did not know how he was taken or why he was on the island. The only thing that he remembered was walking home from work one night and getting hit on the head, hard. When he woke up he was on the raft on course to the island. He also had no idea why he was on the island he had not done anything, compared to the other people on the raft he was the best of the bunch. He had heard some of the others speak of crimes they committed, he had heard all types of crime from petty theft to murder.<br>
        A few hours later, the scientists came back to the island with the guards and gave everyone a small portion of food. What looked like the lead scientist then shouted that he was making an announcement 46 of the 48 people came to the meeting the other two were missing. But the scientist made his announcement anyway, he said that land would be distributed for farming. He said the island was 48 acres in total, and that everyone would only get one acre of land.<br>
        The land that Dryden received was far inland and not near a source of water. He was placed in a dense, dark forest with a small clearing in the center of the plot, the soil was rocky and dry it was not suitable for farming. His plot of land was not ideal. He was also given the basic tools for building a small farm. In about 1-2 weeks Dryden had a small shack in the middle of his plot. The trees that he had cut down to make the farm he used to build his house. However, his farm would not produce all the food that he needed after a week from building his home. By the end of the first month, he was living on just enough to survive. There were rumors that some of the people of the island had died of starvation, but Dryden didnâ€™t believe in rumors or myths. On the morning of the 45 days on the island, Dryden was awoken to the sound of loud shouting. Then when Dryden went to investigate the shouting it was the scientists and their guards. After an hour only 29 of the original 48 people were there.<br>
        The rest had been reported missing to the scientists. The rest of the people, including Dryden were given a loaf of bread and after this, the scientists left. After another 2 months past, Dryden had established a large farm and he was doing a little better for himself. However one night Dryden heard loud noises outside his shack and he checked outside his shack and found someone running away with half his crop. After this Dryden had to go on a meager diet because of his crop being stolen. He got so hungry that he had to eat small animals to stay alive. In the next month, Dryden was dead from the harsh cold of the winter. </p>
