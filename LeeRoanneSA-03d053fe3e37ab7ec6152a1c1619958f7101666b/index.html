        <h1>DEAD BUT ALIVE</h1>
        <p>“OMG!” exclaimed Isla, as she woke up from a terrible nightmare. Her dead father had come out alive in her nightmare, cornering Isla to a room that was dark and filled with glowing skeletons dangling from the ceiling. Isla quickly sat straight up on her bed, with sweat falling down the side of her face. She quickly looked around at all angles, making sure that she was not cornered into the room with skeletons. Isla had been having a lot of nightmares ever since her father had passed away three months ago. Her father had been her best friend just like how he was to Isla’s own mother as well. Ever since Isla’s father had passed away, Isla’s mother seemed to be acting a bit weird. Weird to the point where Isla was getting scared to communicate with her mother. Her mother seemed to be acting like her dead father, or sometimes even her dead grandmother who had died two years ago.
	Isla got out of bed and went out to the living room to find her mother. Isla’s mother was usually in the kitchen every morning, so she decided to go there. While walking towards the kitchen Isla called out, “Mom!” in a loud voice.
	“Yes sweetie?” Isla’s mother replied. “Do you need something?”
Isla was going to ask her mother what they were going to eat for breakfast until she saw her mother acting strange. Her mother was making some coffee and a toast, two things that her mother had hated but her father had loved. Isla suddenly froze, slowly starting to get nervous. This had not been the first time she had seen her mother acting like her father. The day before, Isla’s mother had gone out to walk at the park. When Isla’s father had still been alive, he had loved to go walk at the park. But he had always gone alone because his wife, Isla’s mother, had always hated going on a walk.
	“Mom? Why are you making yourself coffee and toast? Didn’t you always hate those two?” Isla asked in a nervous tone.
	“What do you mean honey? I absolutely love to drink coffee, and I always eat toast every morning! Is something wrong sweetie?” Isla’s mother asked in a concerned voice.
	“O-oh right! Of course mother! You have always loved both coffee and toast. I think I might still be half-asleep,” Isla quickly said. But this was a lie. Isla was not half-asleep, and she was also absolutely sure that her mother had always hated both coffee and toast. Something was wrong with her mother, and she was starting to worry something bad was happening to her.
	The next morning, Isla quickly woke up to another nightmare. This time her dead grandmother had cornered Isla to a room filled with big, black spiders. Still shaking from the nightmare, Isla got out of bed and went out to the living room. But something seemed a bit off. The living room was filled with a sofa, a television, and a small rug in front of the sofa, the usual stuff. But then there were black curtains and dark, blue lights hanging across the wall that was facing the sofa. The area seemed to be carrying a dark mood, something Isla’s father had always loved. Isla’s father had always wanted to decorate the family’s house so that it carried a dark and a quiet mood. But Isla’s mother had always liked something bright and simple, so the family’s house had never carried a dark mood....until now. Isla’s heart suddenly dropped when she saw her mother standing in the kitchen with the lights off, making coffee and a toast once again. Isla walked towards the kitchen with a thumping heart.
“Mother?” Isla called out. There was no response. Instead, her mother looked up to Isla. Finally her mother said, “Isla are you feeling fine? Why are you calling out for your mother? Do you miss your mother? Your mother might not be here anymore, but I will always be here for you honey.” Isla’s mother then approached Isla holding a worried expression on her face. Isla started to back away step by step, getting scared as her mother came closer and closer to her.
	“No! N-No! Stop it! Stop getting closer! Stop acting like father! S-S-S-STOP!” screamed Isla with a trembling voice.
But Isla’s mother approached closer and closer saying, “Isla? Isla honey. What’s wrong with you?”
All of a sudden Isla’s vision got dark. Then Isla quickly woke up back in her bed with her heart still thumping, and her body still shivering. Isla had woken up from the worst nightmare she had ever had.
