                Gone in the woods <br> 
               Once there was a little girl named Oliva who lived in the woods a long time ago. She lived with her parents and brother in a rental house because they were not wealthy and that was the most affordable option.  Her and her family were happy to be able to live in a house because most of their lives they spent in a small apartment in the city. Although this was a big change for them because they mostly lived in the city, they liked living in the woods a lot. 


                The little girl was always very different after living in the woods. She would do weird things and say weird things in her sleep. Her parents were very worried about their daughter and therefore took her to see a doctor. The doctor prescribed her medicine and shots she had to inject herself with everyday. They thought this was starting to work but it wasn’t everything just got worse. Suddenly, one day the innocent little girl killed both her parents while they were sleeping. This was a big surprise because everyone thought she was getting better. She did not kill the brother but as soon as the brother found out he called the police and they came right away. By the time they came the little girl was gone. Her brother was scared and once everything got situated, he was sent away to live with his grandparents and aunt. Now where did the little girl go? No one knows till this day but think that she lives in the woods and feeds off of dead animals and kills animals to eat them and survive. The little girl never ages though and this problem was going on throughout her whole life while living in the woods, although none of the doctors could diagnose this problem. 
                
                
                The city got situated and it became a bigger city with more houses being built and people moving in, it was like a brand new community. There was a school, a hospital, a police station, and many houses. The house the little girl lived in was all the way at the end and no one lived there and no one lived in the house next door to it. Simply because everyone was scared that the little girl still lived there. One day, a teenage girl and her family moved into the house next door. The girl’s name was Amelia. They moved to this house because it was cheap and very big for the price. Their business was not going well and the mom decided she was just going to work at the hospital in the community. Amelia was not very happy when they got there because she missed her old home and the friends she had at her old school. She also hated the fact that she would have to go to a new school and make new friends. When they arrived She asked her mom “Do you think the kid here will like me and want to be my friend.” Her mom replied with “Yes I think that they would love to be your friend and if not they would be out of their mind because you're an amazing girl.” The girl was annoyed because of course asking her mom would not be the best idea because her mom would always try to make her feel better and be on her side. Soon after they got there they went inside and took a look at the house. The mom exclaimed “Wow this house is huge!” Amelia looked at the rest of the house and went inside the room in which would be her room. It was huge but quite empty and echoey. After getting situated in their new house, they went to the community's small welcoming gathering. 


                It was a hot day and there were kids and a teenage boy in the pool. Amelia’s mom said “Oh Amilea go try to make friends with that boy he looks like he's your age.” Amelia said under her breath “Okay mom, whatever ever you say.” She started walking toward the pool and the boy said “Hi so your new right, do you want to join us in the pool.” She responded with a “Yeah I am the new girland no, i’m okay i’ll just watch. ” They started to all get hungry and decided to eat. They were all talking and the boy said to the family “Do you guys know what happened in the house next to you?” and they all said “No?”  He said “Oh well basically, it was dark, scary and the wind howled in the night. Everyone in the house was asleep and the daughter killed both of her parents and people think now she lives in the woods and her spirit stayed in the house, and she comes out at night to feed on things around the house and woods.” Amelia and her parents looked very scared. The boy’s parents said “Knock it off.” As the day went Amelia and her parents went home to unpack.


                Amelia got curious and decided to go out and explore at around 12am. She went to the woods to look around and didn't find anything. Then she was curious and went to the house where the girl lived. She was frightened when she heard a noise come from the house but still decided to go in. So she went inside and nothing happened. But when she went back outside to go back to her house she was taken by a weird thing then the weird thing made her go to sleep. It was the girl. She was still alive and was going to feed on Amelia. 


                Amelia’s parents wondered where their daughter was and called the cops so that they could help. They finally found Amelia and Olivia, she was about to eat Amelia. They saved her and after that they took Olivia to the mental hospital nearby and Amelia and her family moved back to the city. Amelia saw her friends again and was happy to move back. Then the family lived happily ever after in the city with no more evil spirits and problems.
