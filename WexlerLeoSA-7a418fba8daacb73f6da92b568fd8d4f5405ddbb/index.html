            It was mid-october, and the weather was awful. It was hot enough to not be able to go for a walk, and cold enough to not be able to get in the pool. That wouldn't really matter because nobody in Buckling owned a pool. The town of Buckling Idaho was a small one, one of those towns where everyone knew each other, and nobody liked each other. One of those towns you would only end up in if you made a long turn and kept going for 50 miles. There was one school, one barber, and one restaurant that served edible food. Buckling Town School was not the place you would want to spend your childhood. There was one class in the entire day for each grade, and the teachers were picked from the most cranky old ladies who lived in town. The only real friend group in the school was that of Billy, Asher, and Dustin.

            Billy and Asher had known each other since kindergarten, and Dustin joined in highschool. They were all in 10th grade at the time, so they had known Dustin for a while at that point. He was the pride and joy of the town, as nobody could compare to his skill of hunting. He would regularly bring trophy game out of the woods, day after day. He could shoot a soda can off a telephone pole from the other side of town and some, and was so quiet sometimes even his foster parents would go downstairs to check if he was still there. He always was, sitting there looking at the television that had been broken for 3 years. Nobody could get him out of the chair if he didn’t want to leave, and at this point nobody really tried.

            This was the weekend that the boys decided to do something illegal. Just a minor crime to add a little spice to their otherwise useless lives. They wanted to kill a Pekingese Jack Rabbit, even though they were currently wildly out of season. It was not a big deal, people killed out of season game all the time. The only problem was that that was the weekend Dusting decided he wanted to do something very illegal. He wanted to kill something bigger. Something intelligent. And he knew the perfect target.

            At 3 o’clock on sunday afternoon, they headed into the woods. They got on their gear, and brought the two best rifles they owned. Dustin trailed behind them, which was unusual but nobody asked any questions. They got to the spot and layed out their stuff. And then they waited. At 4:45, Dustin let out a snicker. And then another. They boys looked at each other and then him. Dustin never made any noise, let alone when hunting. He began to laugh harder. “Dusin.” Billy said. But he just laughed harder. Dustin was always a glum fellow, and to hear him laugh was unheard of. But this was not the laugh you would make when something funny happens. This was an ear piercing horrific laugh. The laugh of a killer. “DUSTIN,” Asher yelled, ”why are you laughing!”. And out of dustin's lips came the words that sent shivers down the backs of the two boys. “Because you're gonna die.”

            He grabbed the gun, and instinctively asher grabbed the other. Billy bolted. By the time Asher aimed, two bullets were in his head and chest, the mark of a hunter killing a pig. The cackles of Dustin echoed through the valley. “BILLY” Dustin screamed, “I KNOW YOUR HERE BILLY. COME HERE AND SEE ASHER. HE LOOKS SO HAPPY, SO PEACEFUL. WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO HIM.” Boom. Dustin whipped around and shot Asher's hand with god-like precision from behind a tree. Billy ran behind a rock that was instantly shot by a Dusting rifle. Dustin knew this terrain and could predict where Billy would go, so at this point he was just toying with him. What he did not expect was what happened next. Billy flung himself over the rock, holding an entire bear trap in both his hands. It had been placed behind the rock earlier by the Schmitts, who lived nearby and hated the bears. As he flew through the air, he was instantly shot, but it was already too late. The bear trap bonked Dusin in his head, cage down, and activated. They laid there, both dead, a mile from the closest house. And then the birds sang. And the squirrels stirred. And a pekingese Jack Rabbit made its nest for the long winter ahead.
