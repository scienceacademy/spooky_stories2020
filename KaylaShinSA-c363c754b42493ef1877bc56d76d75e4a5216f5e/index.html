            <p>“Lucy, can you run an errand for me really quick? I  need it right now.” our mom said. Groaning, I dragged my sister downstairs with me and was about to go when I realized that I forgot my wallet inside.</p>
            <p>“Hey Lucy, can you go get my wallet for me? I forgot it.”, I asked Lucy.</p>
            <p>“Oh my gosh you are so annoying fine I’ll get it but next time you go get it.”, Lucy responded. “Ok, ok sorry I’ll go get it next time thanks!”, I said. “I’ll be right back,” Lucy said.</p>
            <p>I waited patiently, tapping my foot and crossing my arms under a streetlight. The streets were dark and the roads were empty. It was completely silent. I started to get nervous, as the speed of my tapping foot increased.</p>
            <p>I felt a piece of cloth covering my mouth as I was pulled away from the light. The only thing that I could see was a large white van of which I was shoved into, vigorously.
            As soon as I got in the vehicle, I heard a cold voice.“Drink it peacefully or I’ll make you take the shot instead”. Terrified for what was to come, I surrendered and obeyed.</p>
            <p>I felt a cold and gross liquid run down my throat, making me gag.</p>
            <p>The taste was bitter. It burned down my throat like fire. I couldn’t help but cough though each breath felt like a thousand needles piercing my neck.</p>
            <p>I glanced around the van, only to realize that the windows were pitch black. My heart sank to the bottom of my stomach. I knew that one could see me and no one could help me.</p>
            <p>A few seconds later, my eyelids started to drop and I fell into unconsciousness.</p>

	        <p>When I woke up I was in a plain white room. All there was was a one-sided window and 2 beds. I was on one and another person was on the other. Obviously, I was kidnapped but the memory before that was a little blurry.</p>
	        <p>“Hey I’m Navet”, the girl on the bed said.</p>
            <p>“Oh hi I’m, I’m… Sorry, I don’t remember”, I said dumbfounded.</p>
            <p>“Oh it’s ok I was like that too but there’s a name tag on your bed, it says your name is Lily,”</p>
            <p>Lily? That name sounded so unfamiliar to me. I couldn’t believe that I had actually forgotten my own name.</p>
            <p>“I can’t remember anything about myself but I guess that’s a start,” I said sadly.</p>
            <p>“Oh. That’s alright. I’ll tell you about this place since you’re confused. I’ve been here for about a week now.
            He gives us food and well, I got a shower every other day while a white-clothed person guards us every second”, Navet whispered.</p>
            <p>I started to panic. “Help! Help!”, I started to shout. “It’s no use. No one will respond to you and no one will help you. Trust me, I’ve tried.
            They act like they aren’t there but they’re watching your every move.”, Navet said.</p>
            <p>I felt my eyes starting to tear up. I wanted to go home! I didn’t know why they kidnapped but all I wanted was to get out.
            After what felt like days of crying, I gave up calling for help. The only thing I could do was observe.</p>
            <p>I noticed that the food shrank as the days went on. The first few days were unnoticeable, but I could definitely tell that it was half of the amount of the food  since last week.
            After I was forced to drink that mysterious liquid, I was placed in a fully surveillanced room with no windows , and was getting fed less and less everyday.
            At this point I assumed that I was part of some kind of experiment.</p>

            <p>The next day was just like any other day in the room. I woke up, shaking Navet awake as well,”.</p>
            <p>“Navet, get up it's morning, breakfast is coming soon”, I said. But she didn’t reply. I tried to make her get going once more again but she never made the slightest move.
            I put my finger under her nose and waited for a breath but, there was no breath. She was dead. I couldn’t believe it, I checked her wrist but there was no heartbeat. I cried out loud with despair.</p>
            <p>“Someone help her please! She died Navet please don’t go please say you’re joking”, I cried. Soon enough people who were wearing white suits came in and took Navet away.
            I tried to escape when they opened the door but I just got pushed back into the room. Then I noticed, there were people in a room right in front of me. Simply skin and bones.</p>
            <p>Why was I so healthy and full but they looked like their soul was sucked out of their body? The difference was big and by big I mean huge.
            I couldn’t understand why we were so different, were we being tested on different things? Did they drink the same liquid I did? Whatever it was I didn’t know, but I needed to find a way to get out.</p>
            <p>I looked at the situation and looked for the timing when everyone was distracted. I glanced at the door and I took a look at the people and made a run for it.
            My legs were moving so fast I couldn’t even see where I was going. What I knew was that I needed to find the main gates that lead outside.</p>
            <p>I ran like I could barely even breathe. I most likely skipped a heartbeat.
            Then it was there I pushed the huge metal doors with the rest of the strength that I had and there were flashing lights. Blue and red I wasn’t sure of the other colors.
            I smiled and felt the joy in my brain filling all the way up to the top.</p>
            <p>It was the best feeling I had in days of the suffocating room.</p>
