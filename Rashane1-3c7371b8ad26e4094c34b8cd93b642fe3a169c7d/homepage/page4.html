            <p>I adore the people who teach at the crash course channel because they make it so easy to understand a certain subject while having fun doing it.</p>
            <p>I like watching them teach because they make it fun to learn and see how everything around us works.</p>
            <p>Right now I am using Crash Course to get ahead in some subjects like AP Physics</p>
