            <p>I really enjoy watching people do playthroughs or let's plays on certain games. A let's play is basically a series of youtube episodes about a game.</p>
            <p>I like watching youtubers play games as tutorials or just to see them fail a bunch of times.</p>
            <p>It also allows me to improve at those games, so it's a win win!</p>
