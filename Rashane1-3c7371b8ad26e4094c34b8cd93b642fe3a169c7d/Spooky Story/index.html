        <H1>The Man in the Cabin</H1>
        <p> He’s the town’s black sheep, but no one really knows much about him. This old man always wears those sunglasses and that black hat. He wears an old leather jacket and his whole outfit makes him look like he’s a biker. The thing is, he has a cane and his skin isn’t the healthiest, even though not much is shown. This man lives in the cabin on the edge of the woods, where the boundary between the forest and the town is. Everyone is skeptical and fearful of the woods and along with the woods, the man. People wonder why he covers himself up so much and he wears that same outfit even when it is 100 degrees outside. He comes into the town only to get some groceries sometimes and speaks to people rarely. No one dares to tread from the town into the woods where his cabin lies. It seems as if there are more than thousands of stories written about him as plays or as novels in this lonely, gloomy town. It’s as if the old man has lived for so long in these woods. Why does he wear that same outfit each day? Is it to cover who or what he really is?!
</p>
        <p> He walks out the cabin, dragging himself into town for some errands. He makes stocking up on food look like torture in purgatory. “The chuck steak and Ribeye,” he says without a care for manners. 
	A child looks over at the over clothed person,”Don’t look behind you, Lily. Just don’t look,” he whispers.
	“No way! Th-Tha-That’s…”
	“Shut up, Lily. Have you not read those stories, idiot? Don’t look at him,” he says carefully.
The butcher sweats slightly and rushes to give him the meat,”Here is the meat, it-it’s on the house.”
</p>
        <p> He notices everything around him in that town. He notices every detail to the microscopic level. He hears. He sees. The butcher’s breath accelerates slowly while the kids speed walk away hoping no one realizes. A couple turns on this street but then turns right back around immediately. The butcher starts shaking and speaks again,”Um, si-s-sir? Would you like something else? I have plenty of-”
</p>
        <p> He starts walking towards the forest, hearing the whispers and gossiping even after he hears the crunching of autumn leaves under his heavy boot. A couple minutes later, at his cabin, it appears that the old man has a gigantic amount of meat like some extreme collection. The strange man only goes into town every couple weeks and buys a couple pounds of meat each time. It isn’t like he buys any other foods, so how could he stock up on this much meat without eating? Unless … No it can’t be true. It isn’t possible that the stories are true. He ate the meat that he bought but needed another source of food, which can only conclude to killing animals on his own. The old man doesn’t have a license to hunt animals. It gets even worse. The meat isn’t even the meat of cows. The things that he killed weren’t animals; they were humans.
