            “This isn’t a normal survey is it. Is this even a survey? Why are we underground? What kind of operation are you even running here?” Jack asked.

            “You’d be correct sir, but at this point, we both know that there’s nothing you can do except listen to us and that is what you will do if you want to have a chance of making it out alive,” the receptionist retorted as they continued to walk.

            Jack felt nauseous. He was petrified and the worst part was he was helpless. There was nothing he could do and he knew it. All he could do was walk down the road to his demise. He decided to take a look around. He noticed he was passing a series of doors. They passed 200, then 201, and then 202. Jack thought, “Could there be other people behind those doors? Are they going through the same thing I am? Maybe I should run -- just run and knock on the door. I’d knock so hard, so loud, they’d have to let me in.” He decided against it though, thinking, “Well if they’re going through what I’m going through, I doubt they’d even be able to let anyone in without the fear of them being hurt. What can I do? Nothing? Please, God, save me. Please!” Tears streamed down his face as they continued to walk. He saw room 215, then 216, and then 217, and he was startled by a loud, “Stop!” It was the receptionist's voice.

            “This is where I die,” he thought, as they walked into the room. Jack scanned his surroundings. He seemed to be in some kind of large, forest-like bio-dome. Before he had a chance to ask what was going on, the receptionist and security guards exited the room. He tried the door but it had been locked from the outside. Suddenly, he heard the word, “Run,” being blared over some kind of loudspeaker. Jack decided to take the advice of the voice, not wanting to think about what he might be running from.

            After that, he heard a series of instructions: “Listen good, um, test subject 217. You’re only getting these instructions once. The total diameter of the enclosed habitat you are currently residing in is 5 miles. If you can make it to the other side of the forest, you will be set free and given not just $2000, but $50,000 in exchange for your secrecy on this subject. Let the test begin.”

            An eerie silence fell onto the forest. Jack could not hear a sound. There was nothing else with him. “This is easy, he thought. Too easy.” Just as he was about to deliberate what kind of terrible fate awaited him, he heard the loudest noise he had ever heard in his lifetime. A noise that brought him to his knees. A terrible, horrible, shriek that sounded inhuman. A fusion of pain and fury brought together. He now understood why he needed to run.

            He ran for what seemed like an eternity. He estimated it had to have been for ten or twenty minutes, which he knew was not enough time to cover a 5-mile distance. He needed to stop. His legs and lungs hurt and he felt the onset of a headache. It was as he stopped to listen, though, that he realized something was amiss. He could hear noise. It sounded like the galloping of a horse, but stronger. He realized he could feel the slightest of tremors, almost as if the ground had shaken every time he heard the footsteps of what he could only assume had been the thing that made that wretched noise. Instead of continuing to run, he decided to stand his ground. Running would only cause him to lose more energy in his inevitable face-off with the monster he was trying to escape. He found an arrowhead on the ground and tied it to a stick with a vine he found. It was not the best weapon, but it was better than using his hands.

            After 5 minutes of waiting, he started to see a figure appear. It ran on four legs. As it got closer he started to doubt himself. That was until he got a closer look. The thing was very bony and covered in a crisp layer of skin resembling leather. It had eyes that sunk into the back of its head and had three, massive claws protruding from each of its feet. It was very big, though, reaching at least 8 feet in height, staring down at poor Jack, trembling in place. It began to open its mouth, revealing row upon row of razor-sharp teeth and it grinned at him. Its eyes widened as it prepared to feast on poor Jack.
