            Escapism

            Jack Marshall was reading the paper one night, just like every other night, gliding right past the business section and straight to the funnies. A Dilbert comic caught his eye. One guy says to the other, “I have no social life and I need extra money? What should I do?”
        </p>
        <p>
            His friend responds, “You’re one Prius away from becoming an Uber driver.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Jack thought, “Maybe that’s what I should do? I am out of work.” Just then another thought crossed his mind, “<i>You’re always unemployed. Can’t keep a job if your life was on the line. Get your act together or we’re not going to help you anymore.</i>” It was his mother’s voice. He knew she was right, though. He couldn't keep a job and he was in desperate need of some money. He fruitlessly searched for more answers to his life's problems in the comics, but he knew he would find nothing. That is until an intriguing ad caught his eye.

            “Come to 123 Delano Street to participate in our survey. Upon completion of the survey, you will receive a $2000 cash reward.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Jack believed he had hit the jackpot. “Finally, some easy money,” he thought. “Time to prove ‘em wrong. Prove ‘em all wrong. I’ll use this two-thousand in the stock market and make $10,000, no $100,000.” He continued to think about the great things he could do with this small amount of money for some time until he checked his clock. 11:30 PM. “I’ll need a good night’s sleep for this survey. Once I get this two-thousand I’ll be set I tell ya, set. With just this two-thousand I’ll turn my life around. No more stupid paper, no more Dilbert, no more of this misery, just sweet mansion living for me.” Who he was talking to even he did not know, but after his ramblings he went to sleep and dreamt of the amazing life he was going to have after it the survey was complete.

            The next day, Jack woke up with newfound confidence. He was going to complete this survey, get this money, and fix his life. He got in his car and turned on the radio. He flipped through the channels until he came across Mr. Blue Sky. He kept it on and drove down to the place that would change his life.

            He rolled into the parking lot at the address listed and saw a huge brown office building in front of him. He felt a sense of foreboding as he entered. As he walked in, though, a wave of relief washed over him as he was greeted by a receptionist at the front desk.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Are you here for the survey?” she asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yeah. Quiet a big building for a small little sheet ain’t it? How many people you got here?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “We do have multiple people taking this test, but I can’t disclose any more than that. Right this way sir.” She led him to the elevator and hit 3. Jack immediately felt strange. “Are we going down?” he thought. His presumptions were correct. They emerged in an underground tunnel and began walking. He noticed that they were also now being escorted by what looked like two security guards.
