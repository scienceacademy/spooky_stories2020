      <h2 class="title">story</h2>
      <p>   Tim had just moved into an old scrawny wooden house with an old lady after his father passed away two months ago. Tim and the old lady never really talked and stayed in their private spaces. But the only thing the old lady told him did not go into the basement. Tim never really cared about the order so he just ignored it. The first time he got interested was when the old lady brought a dead black cat into the basement and wondered what that was to be used for. She would only come back out to buy bread for Tim and herself. They didn’t eat anything else. One day Tim wandered down into the basement to see what was in it. He was shocked at what he saw. The stench was horrible and he ran back up to his room immediately. He didn’t come out until it was time for his dinner. The old lady knew that something happened and that’s when she asked “You went down to The basement didn’t you.” Tim said he didn’t and the old lady decided to brush it off. Tim couldn’t sleep that night. It began to rain hard and he could hear the water dripping down into the hallway. Then he heard footsteps. They were quiet but loud enough to hear. He wondered what someone the old lady was doing this late at night. He hid under his blanket but then the door to his room opened and then something struck him in the head. 
      </p>
      <p>  When he woke up it wasn’t pleasant. It was the same smell from the basement. The smell of rotting animals. He tried to move but when he looked up he was hanging from chains. When the old lady came down he asked “what’s going on?”
      </p>
      <p>  The old lady replied “No one can know what’s in this basement! I know that you looked in here! You had the same face like all the others when they saw it” 
      </p>
      <p>  The boy knew he was done for. He would never get out alive. Nine other bodies were hanging next to him. 6 on the floor without flesh and just bones. The other three were still rotting. The old woman had sat next to the red staircase. From there a red horned creature came out. The women started saying words from a different language as the red creature got closer and began to open up its wings. Timmy began to struggle and tried to break free of the chains but the chains wouldn’t budge. The woman spoke to the creature “It has been a long 4 years my friend.”
      </p>
      <p>  “Yes, it has.” The creature spoke.
      </p>
      <p>  “Wreak havoc upon this corrupt land and eat until your heart’s contempt. Start with this boy. ”
      </p>
      <p7>  “I shall gladly accept your offer.” The red creature proceeded to eat Timmy as he screamed. It appeared that Timmy had not yet died even though his lower parts of the body had been devoured along with his torso. 
      </p>
      <p>  “He has a power that lets the human or animal stay alive and feel all the pain when he eats them,” said the lady “you must be going through hell right now. ” Timmy then fainted and when he woke up he was in a world full of fire and he could hear voices around him and he looked down to see he had a body. A red body. He had wings as well. The boy had realized what happened and is stuck there until this day.
