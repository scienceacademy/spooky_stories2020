            <p class:"serif">During a silent October night, Harry was staying up late for homework. Suddenly, he heard a window shattering to his left, quickly followed by him getting knocked out. When he woke up, he was in a dark room with no windows or doors. As soon as he woke up, he heard a chilling voice like a ghost that made Harry jump.

            <p class:"serif">The spooky voice told him, “For my entertainment, you will be led through some puzzles that would potentially kill you if you make the wrong move.” When he finished, the lights turned on and there were three cups. “Two cups have poison, while the other doesn’t. If you don’t solve this puzzle in a minute, the room will be filled with water and you will drown,” says the mysterious kidnapper. “Your hint is what was the last thing you heard.” Harry’s head was still aching from getting knocked unconscious, so he couldn’t quite remember what it was. On the table, there were cups made of glass, plastic, and clay. Thirty seconds have passed and Harry couldn’t still remember what was the last thing that happened during the night. He tried to recall what happened that day. He was working on his English homework, when suddenly...suddenly...He just couldn’t remember. The kidnapper started counting down from ten. Harry chose a random cup and drank it. He held his breath and the kidnapper said, “Congratulations you passed the warm-up!” Harry was confused at first, but when he looked at the cup he remembered. The last thing he heard was windows shattering while he was doing his homework. Ding! Startled, Harry looked behind him quickly and found an elevator waiting for him. When he got inside, the door closed and the kidnapper told him to wait until the ride was over. Harry took this chance to find some hints about who and where the kidnapper was.

            <p class:"serif">“Who are you? How come this place is different compared to other abandoned places?” Harry asked. Then, somehow, Harry heard him smile.

            <p class:"serif">“My name is a secret, but you can call me whatever you want. This place is one of my favorite places to commit crimes. This place is well-hidden and has some strange, dangerous mechanics that I figured out how to control.” the kidnapper said. 
“I’m going to call you Psycho from now on,” Harry told him. Harry then heard him breathing loudly through his mic and he realized that the kidnapper doesn’t like being called Psycho, but he agrees. The elevator stops after the awkward silence between Harry and Pscho. 
“Your next challenge is to get across this puzzle by choosing the correct door three times!” Psycho stated. Harry looked at the three doors. From one of the doors, he heard lots of hisses and concluded that there were more than 100 snakes in that room. From the second door, he heard some mechanics turning on and turning off. From the third, he heard bubbling liquid which he assumed will kill you. Whichever door he chooses, Harry felt that he wouldn't be safe. During the elevator, he told me this place was full of dangerous mechanics so it is not the second door. I heard something melt in the third door so that’s not it either. The only door left is the snake room. There is a chance that this room isn’t full of poisonous snakes, Harry thought. When he went through the first door, his guess was correct. There were about 100 snakes in the room, but they were not poisonous, but instead, they were constrictors. While the snakes were squeezing Harry, Psycho started to say, “I can either fill the room with fire or freeze the room. Choose wisely.” Harry knew that if he froze the room, he would get frozen too along with the snakes, so he chose to fill the room with fire. After all the snakes were burned, Harry was burned severely. His conscience was slowly fading while hearing his kidnapper maliciously laughing. His skin peeling off from the burn. He closed his eyes and lost consciousness. Harry woke up and was being carried by someone. The person whispered and sounded extremely familiar. “This is the worst part. Cleaning after the dead body.” Harry acted like he was dead because it seems that the person thought he was dead. As he heard more and more, he realized that this was Psycho. Harry waited until it was the perfect moment to strike Psycho. When Psycho was letting down Harry, Harry shot a jab at him. Psycho recovered quickly and yelled, “So you were alive huh?! You should’ve acted dead and you might’ve lived, but instead you strike me?! Well unlucky you because I’m good at fighting too!.” Psycho pulls out a knife and stabs Harry. Harry feels his warm blood pouring out of him. This time he knew he was about to die. The wound was too deep and huge. Harry was dying. He felt weak and cold. As he was lying down, Psycho was running away. The cops were chasing him and saw Harry. They took Harry to the hospital, but Harry wasn’t going to make it and told the people about Psycho. As he finished the story, he had died.
