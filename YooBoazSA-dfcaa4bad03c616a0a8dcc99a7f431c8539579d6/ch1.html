            It was the night before Halloween, the usual time of the year for the Jackson family to go on their annual
        trip to Camp Gimchijigae, a campsite accompanied by a large chalet. Theodore Jackson and Michelle Jackson 
        had four children, two boys and two girls. The family was quite well-off and owned the campsite and an RV.
        Everyone packed their essential needs into their bags, and put the bags into the clean and organized compartment
        spaces of the RV. Everyone buckled up, and the drive to the campsite started.

            After a couple hours had passed on the trip, Norman Jackson, the youngest of the children looked through the
        moist, fogged up window of the bus and cleared it up with his hand, leaving a wet stain on his hand. He took
        a look outside the window and saw a vast field of land overflowing with tall trees, sprouting with bright
        orange leaves, the color of a goldfish’s scale. There was light snow, seasoned atop the trees, informing Norman
        and the rest of the Jacksons that they were nearing the campsite.

	        “Yep, just a couple of minutes before we arrive,” Theodore replied.

	        As the Jackson’s arrived to the camp, they parked their RV by the chalet’s parking area. Rather than staying in
	    the chalet, the Jacksons grabbed their tents, lamps, and food supplies and head further into the enclosed space.
	    Once walking a couple of miles into the campsite’s forest, they settled on a flat field of land, surrounded by
	    tall trees.

	        After the family had set up their tent, Michelle begins to make snacks for the family to eat after the long trip.
	    Lisa, the second oldest child, started reading a book, isolated from the rest of the family. Theodore went to a 
	    nearby lake and went fishing with his third youngest child, Nathan to look for dinner.

            Despite Norman being the youngest child and Gordon being the oldest, the two had a tight bond that made them best
        friends in a way. Norman was a very curious boy, always trying to figure out the mysteries that surrounded him and
        Gordon was his younger brother’s sidekick who always helped him delve further into the mystery.

            After everyone was asleep, Norman wakes up and heads outside for a fresh breath. Norman discovers a mysterious 
        path between two trees that a tent had been set up on. Because he was so curious to find out what the path led to,
        he put on his hiking boots and ventured on deeper into the forest, following the path.

            “AAAAAHHHH!” Gordon exclaimed as we woke up from a horrible nightmare.
        </text>
        
        <text>
            In his dream, Gordon had seen Norman’s dead body, bleeding out from heavy scars. Norman was talking, but Gordon could
        not comprehend what his brother was muttering. Gordon sprints over to Norman’s tent to make sure it really was a dream.
        When he zipped open his tent, he was not there.

            Next to his tent, he then finds a path with footprints that had been left behind by Norman’s hiking boots. His immediate
        reaction is to follow the trail. In this moment, he did not think of anything else in the world other than saving his
        little brother. After he traced the tracks, he could not believe his eyes. He saw Norman’s lifeless body as his face was
        screaming in pain and agony.

            Gordon, terrified ran back, faster than he’d ever ran in his life. As he was nearing the start of the path, he heard a
        light whisper with a claw scraping his neck.

            “Hello, little boy.”
