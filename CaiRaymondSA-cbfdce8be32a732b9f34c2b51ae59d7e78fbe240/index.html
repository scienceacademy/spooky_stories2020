        <h1>Insanity from a Book</h1>
        <p>
            Mad! Insane! Impossible! Outlandish! You might call this story of mine those terms above, but I swear, I was sane, awake, and sober when these events unfolded before my eyes. What happened over the course of that cursed week will forever be imprinted in my poor head. Therefore, I must tell this story now, in hopes that it will help suppress the terror and trauma that I still experience to this day.
It was a perfect day, the sky was beautiful, the environment was bustling with activity, and there was a gentle breeze blowing through the town. Such perfection, I thought, meant that nothing could possibly go wrong. I greeted my peers with a smile, as I went into the backroom of the bookshop and opened the book catalogue. There was a new shipment of books today, and as I went into the warehouse, I could see the big boxes, which contained all those new books. I excitedly opened the boxes, waiting to see which new books I could read as I got them onto the shelves. There was this one single book, which I had never seen before, just lying at the bottom of the very last box. I picked it up, and saw that it was old, and was bound with leather. The book was colored a dark crimson, and the spine read: “The Red Book”. As much as I was interested and confused about how such an old book got into a shipment of brand new books, I would have to arrange the rest and get going. 
At the end of the day, I picked up the book, finally, after a day of sorting through the rest of the books and picking up a few bits of some very interesting stories that were in them. As I was allowed to stay late and read, provided I locked the shop up, I sat down into the comfy armchair and started reading what was inside of this mysterious book. What was inside surprised me: the book had contained long lines of poetry and many sayings and proverbs, which drew me in even further. In the midst of all these lines, I found a strange message: The one who is the wisest shall endure betrayal by his friend. Of course, I was not frightened at all, for I only assumed this to be one of many strange proverbs, and because I knew that nothing like this would happen, and I surely would not be betrayed by my friend. 
As I went and locked up the shop, I heard a strange noise - the hooting of an owl. It was very strange, indeed, as there were no owls in this area. I began to think of one superstition found in that red book pertaining to owls: When the sound of an owl is heard at the most unlikely times, the person who heard it will endure a tragic fate. I was now feeling nervous, but I shook it off. I went home and decided to retire for the night.
	The next morning, I returned to the bookshop and left shortly after, as I was allowed short work on this day. I decided to meet my friends, and explain to them this strange red book I had found, and the ominous words it contained. I was shocked, to say the least, when my friends did not believe me, and expressed outrage at me even mentioning such things. They started to complain about how I was always talking about books, and how I managed to always disprove themselves. Of course, I decided to be patient, as patience was the only option I had. We decided to talk ourselves out in a pub located nearby, and as the day turned into night, I could see that something was amiss. But alas, I dismissed it as superstition again! If only I had known. Soon, most people left, including all of my friends, except one. We decided to leave soon after, and then, as soon as I stepped out, something dreadful happened. The ground itself gave way, and we both fell down into nowhere. Seeing as we were trapped, I decided to help my friend out, and he would send for help, so that I might also be able to get out of this gaping hole in the ground. As soon as he got out, he leapt away into the darkness, ignoring my shouts and comments. He never returned. As I was pondering why he would leave me stranded like that, I began to realize that I was not alone. I turned around, and then - I met a horrible sight. There was a woman, standing there, in a tattered white dress. Her pupils were dilated, and her head - was severed. I was paralyzed. I knew not what to do. I then realized that she was holding a knife. I turned to flee, but I was greeted with a man who was standing on the opposing side, holding an axe. I stopped, paralyzed with fear. I then remembered what the red book said, and a feeling of horror began to trickle down me. 
To this day, I am still baffled at how I managed to escape that horrible, dark place. But I did learn two things: that I should never touch that red book again if I wanted to live without a curse, and that I should not trust my friends with my life. But alas, I feel I have lost my grip of reality, and that my senses are fading. But I am not insane.
