        <p>It was the strangest thing I ever heard. And it was the last thing my mother said before she died.<br><br>


        My mother had been ailing for years, but her disease only worsened last week. Her disease was a strange one, as she seemed to be able to see the future.
        It was the disease that led my father to become one of the greatest rulers of all time.
        Unfortunately, the disease took its toll.
        My mother began to see blood seeping from the walls in her visions, as opposed to the next bountiful harvest.
        She heard loud, eerie screams, instead of soft, thankful voices singing her kingdom’s praises.
        She even began to go insane, and it was hard to tell if she was making a true prediction or not.
        I eventually had to lock her inside her rooms, worried that she would take to wandering the halls of the castle in her sleep.
        The day she died, however, my mother seemed more lucid than usual.
        She called for a servant to bring me to her chambers, and I had hoped that she was getting better.
        Unfortunately, my hopes were in vain, as the only thing my mother told me was, “The destruction of our kingdom has been swept under the carpet.”
        I looked at her in confusion, and in one fluid motion, reached down and lifted up the carpet, uncovering the floor. My mother shook her head.
        “Not that one. Just remember-.” She paused to take a rasping breath, and she paled rapidly.
        “Just remember, the destruction of our kingdom has been swept under the carpet.”
        She breathed out, and died in front of my eyes.<br><br>

        I was inconsolable.
        I rarely left my room, despite my responsibilities to my kingdom.
        I ate only when my servants brought me food, and when I slept, I had terrible nightmares.
        Eventually, however, I remembered what my mother had said: “The destruction of our kingdom has been swept under the carpet.”
        I knew that I had to protect my kingdom, and so I resolved to find the destruction of the kingdom and destroy it.<br><br>

        I entered the throne room, and informed my mother’s advisors that I was ready to become King.
        They threw a coronation ball, and then I was finally the ruler of the kingdom.
        After the coronation I made my first edict.
        I said, “From now on, anyone owning a carpet, rug, or other cloth floor-covering must burn all items of this type.
        The possession of any of these items will result in a public execution.”<br><br>

        My people, who had once been cheering loudly for me, began whispering furiously amongst themselves.
        They were happy that I had replaced my crazy mother, but now I was proving to be just as crazy as she had been, so I spoke up again,
        “My mother's last words were that there was something under a carpet that would destroy our kingdom, so please comply with the law.”<br><br>

        Many of the citizens of my kingdom thought that I was as crazy as my mother.
        My advisors often told me that I was being a paranoid fool, but I would not back down.
        They eventually decided to send for my cousin, who lived in a faraway land, as her mother was my mother’s younger sister, and was always jealous of my mother’s royal status.
        They were hoping that my cousin could talk sense into me.<br><br>

        When my cousin arrived, I welcomed her into my kingdom with the proper formality.
        As soon as I had finished greeting her, however, I immediately insisted that she follow me into a more private room.
        I then began to tell her of what had occurred.<br><br>


        “Oh, cousin!
        You have no idea of how grateful I am that you are here.
        My mother told me that the destruction of the kingdom had been ‘swept under the carpet,’ and everyone thinks that I am crazy for listening to her, but I do not want to ignore her warning.
        What do you recommend that I do?”<br><br>


        My cousin looked at me as if I was as crazy as the rest of the kingdom thought.
        She said, “She must have been being figurative.
        There is a saying that says that something has been ‘swept under the rug.’
        This means that you are ignoring, or denying something that will destroy the kingdom if you do not acknowledge it.
        You can take back your edict, because it will not make a difference.”<br><br>


        I smiled and thanked my cousin profusely, and decided to follow her advice.
        That very next day, I took back my edict, explaining the true circumstances that surrounded that strange law.<br><br>

        I was incredibly relaxed, and for many years, I ruled the kingdom.
        I was a good ruler, and loved by my subjects, who had graciously forgotten my first mistake.
        My cousin had left, back to her own land, and had promised to return in a few years.<br><br>


        When my cousin finally returned, however, she had been gone for far longer than a few years.
        In fact, it had been closer to two decades since I had last spoken to her.
        She sat down in my drawing room, and scuffed her feet on the floor, playing with the edge of the carpet that I had put onto the floor of my palace as a sign that I was no longer afraid of things hiding underneath them.
        We spoke for a while, and then my cousin left to refamiliarize herself with the castle’s beautiful gardens.<br><br>


        My cousin walked around the castle’s gardens, and then, once she had reached an area in which no one could see her, she reached into her pocket, pulling out a remote.
        She then smiled triumphantly as she pressed a button, activating the bomb.<br><br>


        I sat in my chair for a while, but when I stood up to go and eat, I noticed a red light that was flashing underneath the carpet, in the exact same place that my cousin had been playing with.
        I cautiously moved closer to the light, but before I could remove the carpet covering it, the world exploded.<br><br>


        My cousin smiled.
        She knew that her aunt had known that she was the traitor, and that she had been denying the facts for years.
        She also knew that I was ignorant and naive, and that I was now dead, and she was free to destroy my kingdom, fulfilling the strange prophecy that my mother had uttered before she died.</p>
