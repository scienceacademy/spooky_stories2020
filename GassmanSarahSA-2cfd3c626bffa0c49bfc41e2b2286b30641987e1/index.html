    <p style="color:white">“Who- who are you?” She was trying to be strong, but Lucy’s usually melodic voice quivered.


<p style="color:white">The dark figures advanced toward her, ignoring her nervous question. They flickered on the rims of invisibility, every so often becoming transparent. Glass shattered near Lucy and she had no choice but to back up against the wall.
</p>

<p style="color:white">“What do you- what do you want from me?”, she called to the room. No answer.</p>

<p style="color:white">Lucy felt the beasts’ presence though she couldn’t see nor hear them.</p>

<p style="color:white">She squeezed her eyes shut, sitting with her back to the wall and willing the animals to go away. </p>


<p style="color:white">After some minutes, she nervously glimpsed around to check for the beasts when she saw two shadows standing over her, dead still. They began moving, conjuring shadow-y, misty items from nothing. A bowl and a knife were created from the shadow, moving on their own through the air.
</p>

<p style="color:white">Lucy gaped in horror at the knife advancing slowly toward her left eye. Struggling to move out of the knife’s path, Lucy realized she was completely paralyzed, frozen in one position, one moment of time.
</p>

<p style="color:white">She struggled to move as the knife met her eye. She tried to scream, but no sound came out, for her mouth was stuck closed and her vocal chords suspended in silence. The tears that streamed from Lucy’s eyes did nothing to stop the knife.  It made its way through her eye and continued, aiming for her brain.
</p>

<p style="color:white">The figures, making no noise, proceeded to collect the blood pouring from Lucy’s face with the bowl and began lifting it to their misty heads. They reached out their gaping, mouth-like appendages and poured the crimson blood down it, taking turns until the blood was gone.
</p>

<p style="color:white">The moment the knife pierced Lucy’s brain, she became lifeless. She was simply a corpse with a knife though her eye.</p>

<p style="color:white">
The figures pulled the knife from its resting place in the corpse’s head and made a small incision in her chest, piercing the cotton shirt and the skin. They  created a flap in her chest, and lifting it over, they discovered her precious heart.

Lifting the heart out of the corpse’s body with the shadow-y bowl, the beasts cut the heart in two, each grabbing their respective piece. In perfect unison, they swallowed their half of the heart and, as quickly as they had come, left the glass-filled room.

<p style="color:white">
“Lucy? Hello?”, Mark called, setting his bag on a nearby coat rack. “Where are you?”
</p>

<p style="color:white">Walking to the living room, Mark saw what had taken place: bloodstained glass littered the floor, gathering near his dead roommate. The blood that once spilled out of her eye was now dried . Whatever she had been killed by was now gone.

Lifting Lucy into his arms, Mark examined her pierced eye. She had definitely been stabbed, but with what? He covered her chest wound with a nearby coat. Strange that she seemed to be missing her heart.
</p>

<p style="color:white">Mark tossed the corpse into the fireplace, thereby incinerating it. A foul smell filled the room, decreeing the body being burned a mistake.

Mark sighed. He knew he wouldn’t be able to stay in the house in case whatever killed Lucy came back, but he wished he’d be able to leave it in good condition. The house had come to mean something to him in recent years and he hated to see it damaged.
</p>

<p style="color:white">“No matter”, Mark mumbled. “This place is going up in flames anyway. There can’t be any evidence someone was killed here.”
</p>

<p style="color:white">Picking his bag back up, Mark filled it with necessities: A pair of shoes, a pack of cigarettes, a lighter, some money and a ring of Lucy’s. He put the ring on his forefinger as a token of  his past.
</p>

<p style="color:white">Sparking his lighter, he put the flame to a curtain. The blue, flower-embroidered curtain caught fire almost instantly. Mark gathered his bag and a hat and strolled out the door while the house behind him was subdued by flame.

<p style="color:white"> He had a feeling he wasn’t alone, though he couldn’t prove it. “Who’s there?”, Chris yelled into the hallway. He was met with silence.


<p style="color:white">It was common to hear creaks and moans in the morgue: People were constantly moving in and out of rooms, the cat was jumping around, things would regularly fall. But right now, Chris was the only employee on shift and the cat was sound asleep.
</p>

<p style="color:white">Chris advanced in the hall, careful to make the least sound possible. He opened and left ajar every door he went past. Many of them held covered bodies, some were empty.
</p>

<p style="color:white">Chris noticed something different in room 19: maybe a lingering scent of blood, a certain presence in the room? Then Chris noticed the body. It was mutilated, left open on the table. Upon closer examination, the body’s heart was missing while the rest of its organs had been slashed to bits.

The floor spun under Chris’ feet as he became increasingly nauseous. Grabbing around the room or something to hold on to, Chris felt his hand come into contact with something sharp. Opening his eyes, Chris saw that he seemed to be holding onto a tooth of sorts. Had that been there before?
</p>

<p style="color:white">Chris' felt his hand caressed by a warm, gentle presence - safety? No, it wasn't that, it was colder, darker, and yet inviting.
</p>

<p style="color:white">“Who- who’s there?” Chris swung his head around the room, only adding to the nausea. </p>

<p style="color:white">A distorted noise came in reply. </p>


<p style="color:white">“Who ar-”</p>

<p style="color:white">Chris lay stiff on the ground, a wooden stake driven through his back. The creatures proceeded once again to cut out and eat his heart, slicing the rest of his organs until he was no better than the corpse that lay on the table.
</p>

<p style="color:white">Mark counted crows on his walk to the morgue. They usually would have migrated somewhere warmer by now, but he was grateful the birds had stayed. By the time he arrived, Mark had counted 13 crows. He smiled.

A foul stench filled the air the moment Mark stepped into the morgue. Mark ignored it and continued down the musty hallway. Strange that every door was left wide open. By the time Mark had reached room 19, the smell of intestine and rot was so strong he had to cover his nose with a tuft of his shirt.
</p>

<p style="color:white">Mark examined the body on the table - it had definitely been attacked. He was strolling over to the other side of the table when he felt his shoe come into contact with something warm and squishy. He peered down  into the cold, dead eyes of Chris and immediately sprang back.

Collecting himself, Mark went in for a closer look. He now looked almost identical to the corpse on the table, minus his jet-black hair. His organs, too, had been diced and he as well was missing a heart.
</p>

<p style="color:white">“Oh, Chris”, Mark whispered. “What happened to you?”</p>

<p style="color:white">Giving Chris a slight kiss on the forehead, Mark stood back up and looked to the door, suspicion dancing in the whites of his eyes.</p>


<p style="color:white">“I want to make a deal.”</p>


<p style="color:white">Two Grim Reaper-esque figures appeared in front of Mark. One wrote for some seconds on a notepad and handed it to Mark.
</p>

<p style="color:white"><i>What do you propose?</i>
</p>

<p style="color:white">“I’ll get you your precious hearts. In return, you won’t kill me.”
</p>

<p style="color:white">The figures considered it, speaking in distorted tongues to one another.
</p>

<p style="color:white"><i>Gather one heart every week for us and we’ll spare you.</i>
</p>

<p style="color:white">“Two.”</p>

<p style="color:white">The figures sputtered, confused.
</p>

<p style="color:white"> <i>This is a small town. You’ll run out of people.</i>
</p>

<p style="color:white">“I know.”</p>

<p style="color:white">With this, Mark walked past them and out the door in a confident strut.</p>
