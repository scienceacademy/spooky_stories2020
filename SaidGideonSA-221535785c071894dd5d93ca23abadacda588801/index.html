        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The squirrel lived in a small town on the side of a mountain. It was winter and the lanes of houses were covered in a snowy blanket with icicles hanging from the rain gutters. A thin frost coated the windows to every house and outside one of them was a small, shivering squirrel. The squirrel could see a warm fireplace through the window and some of the humans that lived there adding logs to the fire. <br>
            The smaller human walked towards the door on the other side of the house after one of the large humans said, “Tom, go fetch some more logs for the fire, would you?”
            The human or Tom as the squirrel now viewed him as came around the house towards the squirrel. The squirrel after seeing and feeling the warmness and plumpness of the human in its ravenous hunger, lunged at Tom biting him in the hand. The squirrel hung on and was suddenly warm. He opened his eyes and looked back at himself in the human’s hands. He immediately realized what had happened. Somehow, he and Tom had swapped minds. The squirrel somehow remembered something like this happening in a movie, but he did not know what a movie was. Nonetheless, he dropped Tom and picked up some logs as the large human had ordered Tom to do. He walked inside and set down the logs by the fireplace. The squirrel learned that the larger humans were Tom’s parents. They noticed his abnormal activity but passed it off. Later that night, the squirrel lied down in Tom’s bed thinking about the possibilities as this life form. The humans had a seemingly unlimited amount of food and warm, comfortable living quarters that were much better than his cold, hard den in the side of a tree. In that very tree, Tom was shivering and frightened of what had just happened. With the memories of the squirrel at Tom’s dispense, he had managed his way into the den and now sat thinking. After establishing that he was a squirrel he thought about how this had happened and how he could reverse it. Since it had happened while as he was bitten by the squirrel, he believed in could be reversed in that same way. <br>

	        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After plotting a course back to his home, Tom made his way through the strong wind that threatened to bury him under the soft snow and managed to get to the house. In front of the door, lightly covered in snow, was a key under a mat Tom’s parents kept for emergencies. Tom eased under the mat and dragged out the key. He then proceeded to climb up the door and insert the key into the lock. Slowly and silently, the door swung open on hinges well oiled by his father. Tom came in and began to quietly climb the stairs to his bedroom. Meanwhile, upstairs, the squirrel had been watching Tom’s steady progress towards the house and knew he would enter his room soon. After all, that is exactly what the squirrel knew Tom would do from his memories. Tom came prepared, however, and hid behind the thick banister of the stairs after unlocking the door as it slid open. The squirrel, armed with worn, leather gloves he had used earlier for carrying the wood, long pants, and a warm jacket. The squirrel planned to get rid of Tom before he interrupted his squirrel fantasies in the human world. The squirrel walked out and was immediately pounced on by Tom. Tom climbed up his own legs, currently inhabited by the squirrel to bite his exposed face. The squirrel immediately swatted him down and Tom rolled down the stairs in a furry ball. The squirrel walked down and picked up Tom, who had several broken bones from the large drop. Tom tried to escape the enormous human’s grip but could not escape the cold grasp. The squirrel carried the struggling and shivering Tom outside into the freezing cold wind towards the road. At the road, the squirrel began walking left, down the street towards the bridge. Tom, now seeing his imminent fate, struggled even harder to escape the squirrel’s grasp before being dropped into the frigid waters below. <br>
            At the bridge, the squirrel said, “I am truly sorry but you are a loose end that I can not account for.” as Tom shrieked while being hung over the river. The last thing Tom saw was his own face, with eyes where he could see a squirrel slowly shrinking and then splashing into the water. For a few moments, Tom sputtered and tried to swim but he was immediately caught in a current and forced under. From that day on, Tom’s parents observed an odd change over him but never knew what had really happened to their son. The squirrel, eventually tired of human pettiness and their world, left to the mountain woods without any warning to his “parents,” never to be seen again.
