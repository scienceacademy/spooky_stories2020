<h1>The Evolving Life of Theodore Dixon</h1>

<h2>by Barrie Komsky</h2>

<p>When browsing the library shelves of the Muncie Town Library in February of 1978, the last thing Theodore Dixon expected to find was a book entitled <i>The Life and Legacy of Theodore Dixon</i>. He had few friends, no long-term romantic partners. His successful, snobby brother lived in Los Angeles with his wife and kids. Both his parents had died, and he had moved away from his hometown of Dayton, Ohio in 1957. He knew nobody who would prank him in this way. Then Theodore looked down at the author. Aubrey Dixon, it said. He had always wanted to name his daughter Aubrey, after his sister that died when he was young. He opened the book and noticed that it was published in 2005, further confusing him. Theodore decided to take the book home and see what it was about. </p>

<p>The moment Theodore opened the book, he realized that it must be real. Every detail of his early life was correct: </p>

<h3><i>Theodore Mackenzie Dixon was born November 16, 1933 in Dayton, Ohio to Thomas and Margaret Dixon. His brother, Walter, was CEO of Dixon Steel, a company he started in 1941, in Los Angeles until his retirement in 1992. His sister, Aubrey, born in 1937, died of pneumonia in 1941. He attended Ohio State University from 1943 to 1947 and Notre Dame Law School from 1949 to 1952. His parents divorced in 1941 and his mother died four years later. Theodore lived in Muncie, Indiana as a salesperson and lawyer until his death in 1988--</i> </h3>

<p>Theodore suddenly stopped reading, shocked by what he had just seen. He assumed it was a dream and chose to take a nap, thinking he would wake up and everything would be fine. </p>

<p>Theodore woke up the next morning, feeling shaken by his bad dream. However, he sat up only to find the book sitting next to his bed, staring right back at him. He assumed it was a cruel prank and thought no more of the situation. Theodore would soon regret this decision. </p>

<p>A few months later, Theodore reconnected with an old friend, Mary Tessler. They began to see one another and soon were engaged. They married August 4, 1979 and their love felt like a fairy tale. In 1981, their son, Roy, was born. Three years later, Theodore decided to take his bar exam, and he passed, quickly becoming a successful lawyer. His longer hours led to a rough patch in his relationship with Mary, but, in 1986, Aubrey was born, and their relationship strengthened exponentially. However, it didn’t last. </p>

<p>Theodore soon began to feel, and act, disconnected from everything else. This led to fighting and, eventually, they got divorced in 1987. Mary’s brother, Richard, who had always disliked Theodore, blamed him for the divorce, strongly suspecting him of having a younger mistress. Theodore suddenly remembered the book. He decided to continue reading. </p>

<p>As he suspected, he was supposed to be murdered by Richard later that year:</p>

<h3><i>On August 28, 1987, Theodore was found dead in his brother-in-law Richard’s car. Richard was never arrested and is believed to be roaming free today.</i> </h3>

<p>But, as he read, the book changed:</p>

<h3><i>On August 28, 1987, Theodore was found dead in his brother-in-law Richard’s car. Richard was never arrested and is believed to be roaming free today. Theodore strongly suspected this and attempted to run away, but he was unsuccessful, and Richard Tessler took his life on August 25, 1987.</i> </h3>

<p>Theodore began to use the book’s clues to escape death. With each of his actions, it changed. Sometimes he was meant to be murdered by a friend of Richard’s, other times his cause of death was unknown. In one situation, Richard was caught, but he always died in or near August. </p>

<p>Everything changed when he got a call that Mary died in June. He went home and became a caring father to his children, giving them all they needed. Roy left for college in 1999, when Aubrey was 13. Two years later, Theodore was diagnosed with cancer, and he died in 2003. Aubrey stayed with a friend for the remainder of high school, destroyed by her father’s death. She decided to write about his life to honor his legacy, and her book was published in 2005. </p>

<p>She married in 2008 and had a daughter, Kylie, in 2012, and a son, Mason, in 2016. Kylie had a daughter, Isabella, in 2044, who had me in 2081. It’s now 2100, and the first time machine was invented. </p>

<p>I stole it from MIT, my college. I traveled back to 1978 and placed the book there. Not to save my grandfather, but to disrupt his life and do to mine what should’ve been done from the beginning. I constantly followed him, giving him fear for his life. He never met Mary, but I had to make sure my job was done. I finally left a note by his door and told him to meet me in an alley near his house. </p>

<p>It was damp, as the rain had just passed. The day was fading, but night was not yet ready to emerge. The streets were empty and quiet, nothing like the loud city of Muncie I knew. </p>

<p>Theodore appeared tense when I first saw him, and I quietly stepped closer. </p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for this moment my entire life,” I said. </p>

<p>“What are you going to do to me?” THeodore asked, and I sensed the fear in his voice. </p>

<p>“I’m doing what should’ve been done long ago.” </p>

<p>Without giving him another chance to speak, I sunk my knife into his chest, and as he took his last breaths, everything around me faded. The book disappeared, my hand was fading into the air around me. This had always been my plan. I knew that Aubrey would write the book whether or not he died; even as a baby their bond was unbreakable. I had to see if her growing up with a father figure would change my life, make me happier. Of course, it never did. I grew up rich but lonely, and my parents were never around. I had no friends, and I felt like it wasn’t worth it to live. I had to go dramatically. I didn’t want everyone around me to be gone, they seemed very happy. I wasn’t selfish. Then, MIT invented a time machine, and I knew what to do. I tried, so hard, to make myself and my family happy, but we turned out worse every time. It was like this film from the 1980s that my grandmother made me watch...Back from the Future, I believe. The main character, Marty, accidentally goes back in time after his scientist-friend dies. Everything turns out worse until the last movie, and for me that’s killing Theodore Dixon. Nobody in my family has been happy for years, and it’s better if we’re not born. Since our births, we’ve been miserable, and this will help us all. But as I fade into the air, I realize that I could’ve tried so much more. I’m selfish. I don’t really know how the rest of my family feels, but I have a vision, and it’s of my siblings, my cousins, my parents, every member of my family that comes from this man, fading into the air, and I regret it. I try to run over and save him, but my legs don’t move. I’m gone. Their friends will have to hear MIT’s story about the stolen time machine and always wonder why their closest companion suddenly faded out of exis— </p>
