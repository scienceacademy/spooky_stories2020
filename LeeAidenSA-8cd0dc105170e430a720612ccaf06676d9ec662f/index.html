            <h1>The Gift</h1>
            <p></em>The sun glimmering through the window blinding Alexander as he wakes up. He gets dressed up and gets ready for work. Life has been tough for him for he had just got demoted and divorced. 
            He goes into the warehouse getting greeted by his other coworkers. He spends the day carrying heavy crates into the warehouse. After his shift, he goes to his normal spot. A hill where you can see the moon bright up in the sky. As a kid, Alexander will always visit this spot with his father who passed away due to colon cancer. On this day in particular, he saw another old man at the same spot. He went up to him and started to have a conversation. They were talking about their favorite sports teams and their favorite books. The old man then holds his hand for a good 10 seconds then walks away never to be seen again. He then sees a bright flashing light. The next day he wakes up not clearly remembering what happened the other night. He goes on with his usual routine when he hears one of his coworkers crying. Alex asks him if he is feeling okay and he says that his mother was recently killed by his brother for money. He says he hopes that his brother dies the most painful death ever and states that he wishes to never see him again. The next day there is news that the coworker’s brother died from comitting suicide after feeling way too much guilt. After work, Alex goes to his local gas station and buys a lottery ticket.
            He really hopes to win for he has never been financially well. The next day as the lottery numbers get called, Alex realizes that he has won the lottery. He is very excited and tells all his coworkers about it. He then prays that his love will come back to him for he has won the lottery. The same day later on he gets a call from his ex-wife saying that she is sorry for what she has done and wants to be with him again. He finally feels like his life is coming back together. His wife then asks him if he can get a better job. He is unsure on whether or not he will be able to do this. He just prays and hopes he can get a better job or position. The next day, he is trusted and positioned to be CEO of the company. He feels like there are just too many coincidences going on. Ever since he met the old man, everything others and he himself has wished for has come true. Just to test out his suspicions he wishes for 6 random people to come to the front of his door and for them to bring 3 baskets of fruit. The next day 6 people come with 3 baskets of fruit to his front door. He is sure that it is not a coincidence and that he is able to get whatever he wants and grant others any wish. After realizing this, he would go around granting peoples wishes and using this “power” for the greater good.
            He would go help families praying and was able to help people with disabilities and can grant people anything. He didn’t consider himself a god but somebody who has been gifted from god. He thought that the sole purpose of him being born in the first place was to be able to be gifted with this power to be able to help others. He had never felt more happy knowing he had a true purpose and knowing that he is able to finally help others. He goes around helping people knowing that, that his duty in life. On one stormy night, he returns to his house apartment after a long day of work. He sees that the door is unlocked. He thinks that his wife must have not locked the door. When he enters, he sees that no lights are turned on. As he goes towards the living room, he can see the body of somebody laying on the ground covered in blood. His wife had been brutally stabbed and left in the ground to die. He starts sobbing and wishes for her to be brought back to life. He stays with her dead corpse for a week hoping that his wish would come true just like all the other wishes. One day he hears a knock on his door. It is the cops and they have come to investigate and question him on why the wife has been missing for over a week. He quickly hides the body and lets them come in the house. They have a nice chat while Alex is sweating and feeling guilt.
            He is thinking he should say the truth before the cops suspect him. He can not take the guilt anymore and he admits to the cops everything that happens. He is taken into custody for now until furthermore evidence of him not being the killer is released. He feels like everything is falling apart and that all his work was for nothing if he can't even save the ones he loves. He keeps on wishing and wishing yet none of the wishes are coming true. He wishes for him to be able to understand the truth of this world and why everything is happening. He realizes the reality of this harsh world. All the fighting, suffering, and the hardships everybody goes through. Later on trial, he is accused of being the person to murder his wife and is sentenced for execution. He is heartbroken that he is being falsely accused for killing somebody he truly loved. He is angered that he is not able to help enough people and that he was not able to make an impact in this world even with the power he had. On the day of his execution he makes one more wish. For true happiness and peacefulness to be brought upon this world. The day after the execution water and food source drops drastically. People are dying from hunger and thirst. The sun being blocked from heavy ash and smoke slows the agriculture down. The world experiences the biggest drought and heat wave they have ever felt. Earthquakes measuring at a 9.0 magnitude happen almost daily and giant tsunamis. People are dying left and right everywhere. Then a deadly disease is discovered killing more than half of North America’s population. All these events have created a new atmosphere and environment for organisms. Many organisms start to evolve and become adapted to the ecosystem around them. Morbid terrifying creatures now roam the earth feasting on human flesh. After 2 years all of the population on Earth is practically extinct. Only a few survive grasping their last few breaths before this world is fully over. A month passes and the human population is extinct from Earth. Alex’s final wish has come true. The world is now peaceful and there is no more pain and suffering.
