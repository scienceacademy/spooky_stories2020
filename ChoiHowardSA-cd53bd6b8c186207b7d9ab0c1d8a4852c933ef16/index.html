        <center><p>The world is cold. New York has fallen along with many of the other cities. This wasteland is not my home anymore. It’s a barren wasteland. I’m all alone. My mom died when the first wave occurred. My brother got lost during the second wave. My dad went missing during the outbreak. Dad was on a business trip where he went missing and on the day the whole world seemed to have gone wrong. Dad always went on business trips, but never this long. I always questioned where he always went off to, but he would always tell me that it was none of my concern. I had ignored him for years until now. I’m on a hunt for my dad and last time I checked, he had left his passport at home. </p><center>
        <center><p>It was beginning to turn dark which is where they become more active. I ran home as fast as I could not looking behind me. I made it home safely without any harm to me. I hid in the bunker to wait the night out. I don’t really expect much from that, all I know is that they will never make it in here. At least that’s what I thought. I had one close encounter with them. After the second wave had occurred, I had finished the bunker. I made the grave mistake of not testing the bunker out beforehand with a dummy. I slept in the bunker that day and well it didn’t go as planned. I was sleeping when I see something from the corner of my eye. It was this dark figure who seemed to be foaming at the mouth and twitching. The man’s skin was full of bugs and had many pus-filled holes. I knew what this was. It was one of them. I was ready to blow its head off with my shotgun, but it was out of ammo. The thing looks at me and starts foaming even more. I thought that it was my end right there. The thing starts chasing me with malevolent intent in its eyes. I reach for the door to the bunker. I almost had it, but then, “AAAAAHHH!”</p><center>
        <center><p>I’m dragged into the darkness with it grabbing my legs. “I’m sorry, mom. I’m sorry, dad. I’m sorry bro,” I thought, but then, the thing stops. It starts to scream loudly. Loud enough to blow someone’s ears off. I knew what was going to happen. The thing was calling for backup. I tried to shut it up. I slammed its face with books and everything. Out of nowhere, a banging noise gets the attention of the thing. He lets go of me and I wait for it to get away from me. The noise comes from the door of the bunker which is not a good sign. I quickly dispose of the intruder by hitting it in the head with a bat. The banging continues. This banging alerts more of them. I quickly run through a tunnel that connected to my house. I enter my house and I see outside that it’s nearly morning. I also happen to see the horde of those things outside my window. I had the idea to kill them all just there, but that would alert even more, so I had to lay low. All of a sudden, the banging is silent and I hear shuffling from the tunnel. I start to panic. I realize that the hordes have busted in. I realize that my dad had kept a back door just in case someone breaks in. I quickly make my way to the back door knowing that it is now morning.</p><center>
        <center><p>They start to scurry away from the sunlight and they all decide to run out of the bunker and go into the other massive buildings outside of my house. This made me so relieved and I finally had the courage to go back into the house. Unknowingly, this was the start of my adventures and my journey to find refuge and find what happened to my dad, James.</p><center>
