            <h2>The Forest</h2>
            <p>Levi was on his way home from a friend’s house. He was listening to music on the radio.</p>

<p>He then gets a call from his brother, “Hey Levi, are you almost home? Mom is getting worried about you.”</p>

<p>Levi responds with, “Yeah, I’ll be home in around 20-30 minutes.” They say goodbye and hang up.</p>

<p>Levi then realizes why his mother was so worried: he had been on the road for 2 hours. Then, his radio stops working. He pulls over to the side of the road next to a big forest to try to fix his radio. He looks over at the forest and sees a dim light but thinks nothing of it. Then, someone knocks on his car door. He can’t make out the person’s face but he realized he left the car unlocked. By then, it was too late. A person had climbed inside Levi’s car and knocked him out.</p>

<p>Levi woke up in the middle of the forest not knowing what happened. He was trapped, with no memory of how he got there, no food or water, and no way out. He decides to try to find the way out of the forest and get back to civilization. He starts running for a few hours but he finds nothing. He decides to walk around for a bit to try to find a place to sleep but then he sees a small wooden cabin. He approaches the cabin and sees there is someone standing next to the cabin.</p>

<p>Levi yells out, “Hey! Who are you? Where am I?“ but then the person starts running.

<p>Levi chases after him but then the person mysteriously vanishes. Levi starts wondering if that person knew something or had something to do with him being trapped inside the forest. By now, he had gained his memory back but still couldn’t remember the person standing outside his car’s face. He decides to go to the cabin to go see if there is anything he could eat or drink there.</p>

<p>He thinks, “Even if there is no food or water, at least I can sleep there.”

<p>He started worrying about what would happen if he was sleeping and that person returned but he was too tired to do anything about it. He makes it to the cabin and finds water. Unfortunately, he doesn’t find any food. He then just lies down on the ground and falls asleep.</p>
<p>He is woken up by the sounds of birds singing. It is morning on the next day. He gets up and goes outside looking for something to eat. He then hears a faint “Hello!” Levi follows the sound and sees someone walking around. He runs over to him.</p>

<p>“Hey!” Levi calls out.</p>

<p>The man responds with “Oh my god, I thought I was the only one here. What’s your name? My name is Liam.”</p>

<p>“Hello Liam, my name is Levi, nice to meet you. I found this cabin back this way but I don’t think we’re the only ones here.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Liam asks. “When I found the cabin, there was someone there. I chased after him but then he just disappeared. How did you get here, Liam?”</p>

<p>Liam responds, “Same as you, I was in my car when I got abducted next to the forest.”</p>

<p>Levi responds, “I see, let's go back to the cabin.”</p>

<p>Levi and Liam return to the cabin and just talk about life. Levi goes outside and starts gathering some branches and leaves.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” asks Liam.</p>

<p>“I was in the Scouts. I am going to make a bow and sword to go hunting since I’m starving.”</p>

<p>“Can you get me some food too?” asks Liam.</p>

<p>“Sure, gather some wood so when I come back we can start a fire.”</p>

<p>“Alright.”</p>

<p>After a couple of hours, Levi returns with some birds and chipmunks for them to eat. He finds Liam missing and some stuff thrown around the cabin. Then, Liam returns with some blood on his pants.</p>

<p>“What happened to your pants?” asked Levi.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, I just scraped my leg”</p>

<p>Levi and Liam go back inside the cabin but they decide to explore a little bit. Liam goes first but Levi thinks nothing of it. They find a closet and they decide to open it. When they open it, 2 dead bodies come out.</p>

<p>“Oh no, I think I'm going to be sick,” says Levi.</p>

<p>They decide to not go back there and just go eat. They get their fire started and start eating. After eating they go explore their surroundings. They walk around for a while and find some dirt and a hole. Liam turns a bit pale and tells Levi that he thinks they should go back. Levi ignores him and goes to the hole. He looks inside and sees some more bodies.</p>

<p>He turns to Liam and asks “How did you know there were bodies here?”</p>

<p>Liam says, “I didn't, it was just a coincidence. Let’s go back.” They head back and decide to just go to sleep.</p>

<p>Levi wakes up and looks around. He isn’t in the cabin for some reason. He turns around and sees Liam digging.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, where are we?” asks Levi.</p>

<p>“Hey you, you’re finally awake.” “You were a good friend Levi, ” says Liam.</p>

<p>Then, Liam charges at Levi with a metal shovel.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that shovel?!?!”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter. You don't need to know since you're going to die anyways.”</p>

<p>“Any last words?” asks Liam holding his shovel above Levi’s head.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden, Levi gets out his sword and slashes him in the nape of his neck.</p>

<p>Liam is confused and asks “How did you know to bring your sword? What revealed my plot?”</p>

<p>“You really aren’t a good murderer.”</p>

<p>“When I asked you how you got here you said ‘Same as you’ and said exactly how I got here, despite me not telling you. That got me very skeptical so I had my guard up. Then, when you told me to stop walking and I found the bodies, that did it for me. I was going to kill you when I woke up but I guess you had the same idea, except you failed.”</p>

<p>Liam starts laughing maniacally.</p>

<p>“Why are you laughing?” asks Levi.</p>

<p>“I may die but you will rot in here never getting to be able to see your family!” yells Liam.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden, Liam starts coughing and then the laughing stops. He was dead. Levi, very tired, decides to go back to sleep. Levi wakes up but he is in his home lying in his bed. It was all a dream. Levi gets up still amazed at how realistic that dream was. Then one night while driving home again, his radio stops working. He looks around and sees a forest. By then, after having that crazy dream, he decides to just keep going with a broken radio. While passing by the forest he thought that he saw a small wooden cabin deep in the forest and a person near it staring at him. He speeds up slightly and doesn't look back until he is all the way home.</p>
