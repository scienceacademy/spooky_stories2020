        <h1>In the Night</h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <p></em>“Reporting news, a serial killer is roaming at night picking on victims everyday. There would be a curfew from 9 pm to 6 am everyday, in order to protect our citizens. 
        As you know, electricity is gone during the night, which will make the cities completely dark. Be careful and please follow the curfew."</p>
	    <p></p>“Hey, have you heard the news about the killer? I bet they’re lying to us to do something at night.” </p>
        <p>“Yeah and I don’t think they would lie about that...a curfew isn’t just a joke, Mark.” I said.</p>
        <p>“You’re too naive Mary. Do you honestly believe there’s a serial killer going around everyday to kill people? Do you realize how dumb that sounds?.” Mark scoffed.</p>
        <p>“Mark! Are you serious? Who knows what will happen if you’re out there, in the dark, all alone, without any help? I won’t be part of this.” I relented.</p>
        <p>“You’re such a baby..” Mark chuckled.</p>
        <p>“Are you serious? You know that I can’t let you do that.” I sighed.</p>
        <p>A day passed by quickly and I had no choice but to follow Mark. Although I was scared to go out, I followed Mark outside my door. 
        The wind outside sounded more heavy today than the other days. 
        It sounded like a ghost whispering in my ear. We had to use a thin match to light up our way. This match seemed like our only hope in the dark. 
        Mark grinned as I walked towards him. </p>
        <p>“Don’t worry, we’ll be fine. We’re going to head towards the capital and if we do get caught, just say that you got lost.” Mark reassured.</p>
        <p>“Can’t we just go back? Please? I don’t have a good feeling about this.” I plead.</p>
        <p>Mark ignored me and kept walking. As we kept walking, I saw a glimpse of a shadow at the corner of my eye. I heard a rustle behind me. 
        My heart skipped a beat and I was shaking. When I looked ahead of me, Mark was gone. He was there a minute ago.</p>
        <p>“Mark? Mark…” I whimpered, feeling my tears fill up my eyes. I was alone, in the dark, with a serial killer roaming around. 
        I had no idea where I was..just trees, ground, and the streets. The burning match was my only hope in the dark. 
        I couldn’t just stay at my spot so I decided to roam, to find Mark and go back home. 
        I took a deep breath and then started walking back to where I thought was the direction to home. 
        While I walked for about 5 minutes, I heard the same rustle, the same one I heard before.</p>
        <p>I wanted to scream out loud like I did in the haunted house, that we went a few years ago. 
        The horrible truth is that this isn’t fake and one scream can actually cause my death. I blew out my match so that the “shadow” wouldn’t see the light. 
        I held my breath, trying to not make any noise. I felt a sneeze coming....at the worst timing possible! I tried to hold it but it came out anyway. 
        Silence came after...only my thumping heart can be heard. I heard footsteps coming towards me. I froze like ice, my eyes wide open. 
        The scent smelled familiar...blood! I remembered when I was almost killed when I was younger. A killer was in my house when I had no one. 
        It eventually became a trauma to me which made me not feel safe being alone. My mind went blank.
</p>
        <p>Footsteps faded away and I felt myself coming back to my senses. I started to roam around, trying to look for hopeless help. 
        I got used to the dark after blinking my eyes often. It was as if I had night vision but in a realistic way. After walking a certain distance, I saw..a body. 
        It had blood everywhere...I ran toward the body. </p>
        <p>“Hello? Are you okay?” I whispered.</p>
        <p>I turned the body over and I saw a familiar face. No way...It’s Mark! Oh no...I started sobbing, not knowing what to do anymore. 
        I regretted coming out with Mark. I just wish everything that’s happening is just me dreaming…There’s no way this can be true…</p>
        <p>I felt a poke on my back, like a real sharp one. Is it a knife? I couldn’t breathe and the only thing I heard was a chuckle behind me. 
        Honestly, the chuckle was scarier than the actual act happening. I felt my eyes close…</p>
        <p>The next thing I saw happening was a white ceiling...is this a hospital room? I’m..alive, but where’s Mark? 
        I wanted to shout out loud and look for Mark everywhere. </p>
        <p>“Where’s Mark?” I asked, desperately. </p>
        <p>The nurse was surprised to see me wake up. She called the doctors and shouted for help. </p>
        <p>“She finally woke up after a year! This is a true miracle. How do you feel, Mary?” a doctor asked.
        “Please...tell me where Mark is.” I repeated.</p>
        <p>“Um..who’s Mark? There’s no one in your guardian list called that. Maybe you were dreaming.” </p>
        <p>I was..dreaming? About Mark and everything...no way. I refused to believe it. I ran out the hospital room, ignoring everyone’s calls and the outside. 
        Electricity was back.</p>
