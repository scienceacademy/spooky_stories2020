            Deep in the forest, a melancholic melody plays.  A harp’s soft tune echoes through the tall-standing trees.  As the tale goes, anyone close enough to hear the harp’s song will be put to sleep for an eternity.  John Smith has heard this story for years, the harp in the forest will kill you if you hear it.  At this point, as a sophomore in high school, he was sick of it.  He saw himself as above childish tales such as those with supernatural harps.  Even if it was a popular dare among his peers to head into the forest in the cover of night to hear the harp sing, he simply did not care.  However, one day, he decided to put an end to this story once and for all by going into the woods himself and proving that the “heart of the forest” as it is called does not exist.  The nearby woods were a classic forest.  The trees hung high, with the ground covered in leaves at this time of year.  It was a gloomy evening, with what little sun was left muffled beneath the grey clouds.  He heads in, camera in hand, only to find - it.  Next to a babbling, rocky creek, the harp was there, playing what can only be described as the most relaxing song a man can hear in his lifetime.  So it’s true he thought.  It’s really true.  John, in awe, approached the harp to inspect it when a feeling of sudden tiredness fell upon him.  It was an exhaustion he had never felt before, one that could not be broken by the sheer will to stay awake.  However, before he could fall victim to the refrain’s grasp, a deer slams into his back, not being able to see John under the dim moonlight.  He is snapped out of the harp’s trance and he runs away.  His whole world had been shattered.  What he had once thought was just a myth was true.  This led to further thoughts.  Are all those stories of death true?  How many have fallen victim to that thing?  With the knowledge that the harp exists, he realizes that he needs to destroy the harp and make the tale of the harp only that, a story that only once was and never will be again.

            4 years later, John has graduated from a prestigious college.  However, even as a man of the sciences, his encounter with the harp has stuck with him.  He was once a denier, not thinking a story meant to scare kids could actually exist.  Although he majored in biotechnology, his supernatural encounter stuck with him.  Through his collegiate years, he began to study the paranormal alongside the natural world.  Now that he has returned to his hometown, the time has come, once and for all, to put the story of the harp to bed not by showing that the harp does not exist, but rather, taking it out of existence himself.

            In his side study of the occult, he dug through the history of the town to find any information on this harp.  He found that the legend of the harp, or rather harps, had been told for centuries, with it passed down both orally and written through the generations and that, in these stories, there were several different methods written in the stories to “defeat” the harp’s song, called the “Elegy of the Forest” by some.  He found that these methods were derived from the destruction of other harps scattered throughout his area and that, from the latest stories, only one harp was left, the one he had encountered.  The genealogy of the harps is not known, but what is known is how to destroy them: appease “the spirits within” with a song of your own and that any physical damage is futile.  And so, now back at the town and armed with the knowledge to beat his mysterious enemy, John realizes he is unable to play any instruments.

            John chose the saxophone as his choice of instrument as he found its sound to work well against that of a harp.  Once he bought one, he decided to set up a perimeter around the harp to prevent any more deaths in the time it took for him to create a song that could break the harp.  As he arrived, he saw another individual walk into the ironically inviting forest.  He ran as fast as he could to stop them but he was too late.  They were already lured in by the soft strings of the harp.  He did anything to snap them out, he yelled at them, threw sticks and stones but alas, he could not save them from becoming a victim to the multi-stringed menace.  Now, he thought, is the time to end this.

            The next 2 years of his life was spent learning the ways of the brass woodwind hybrid instrument all while trying to keep people out of the forest.  The time had come, the harp’s end was near.  He began, putting all of his heart into his performance.  He began to feel slightly tired, but he was able to push through by focusing on the music he was making.  It was like his song was a forcefield, protecting him from whatever the harp’s spell could do to him.  As he finished his performance, he noticed the harp’s sound slowly fade into the sounds of the forest.  Eventually, once he had stopped, so had the harp.  I did it, he thought, no more useless deaths at the hand of this instrument.  Suddenly, the harps strings snapped loudly, with a small blue aura emitting off of the harp afterwards.  Anything that was within was released and no more lives would be lost to the harp.  As John brought the harp back to his house to burn, he felt like he heard a faint “thank you” coming from the forest…..
